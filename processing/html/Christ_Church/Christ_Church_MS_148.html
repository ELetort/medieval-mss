                 The manuscript was
                prepared for a younger son of Henry IV, probably <span class="persName">Thomas, duke of Clarence</span>,
                identified by the royal arms, including ‘France modern’ (thus post-1405) and with a
                mark of cadency, in the opening initial (fol. 1). The scribe produced another <span class="title">Confessio</span> manuscript with a similar history of ownership, if
                not patronage: BodL, MS Bodley 294, with erased ownership inscription of Thomas’s
                brother, Humfrey, duke of Gloucester; see Doyle and Parkes, 208. Jeanne E.
                Krochalis, ‘The Books and Reading of Henry V and his Circle’, <span class="title">Chaucer Review</span>, 23 (1988), 50-77 at 57, places the manuscript in the wider
                context of early Lancastrian book-ownership.</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> A variety of late medieval and early modern indications of ownership or use occurs:
                (a) ‘<span class="persName">Champer</span> (?pro)&lt;...&gt; (fol. 163, upper margin, washed, s. xv); (b)
                ‘Nouerunt vniuersie per presentes me <span class="persName">Iohannem hill de Okehampton</span>’ (fol. 207<span class="hi super">rb</span> following the explicit, s. xv<span class="hi super">ex</span>); (c) ‘This is george coper his hande Record of m’ ni\c/colas
                amen&lt;.&gt;’ (fol. 207<span class="hi super">v</span>, amid a mass of pentrails,
                verses, and drawings, s. xvi<span class="hi super">in</span>). Two small signatures of
                comparable age ‘<span class="persName">gerg coper</span> his boke’ and ‘<span class="persName">roger coper</span> his booke’ (along with several
                ‘george’ signatures, the front and rear pastedowns). Cf. ‘by me Georg&lt; &gt; |
                coper’ (fol. 179, s. xvi). </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> More extensive still are indications of ownership by Cottells: ‘By me <span class="persName">markes
                Cottell</span>’ (fol. 132 upper margin, s. xvi<span class="hi super">med</span>); ‘M:
                Cottell’ also wrote verse ‘The wilde and coulte that Runs in pasture . . .’ and ‘god
                saue the Quene Elizabeth’ (fol. 175<span class="hi super">v</span>, upper margin); and
                the verses again fol. 207<span class="hi super">rb</span> (reading ‘wild and wanton’,
                signed ‘by me markes cottell’). Also ‘Mr. &lt;...&gt; <span class="persName">Edward Cottell</span>’, as well as
                signing his name with Greek lambdas below (the front pastedown, s. xvi/xvii). Of
                comparable age is the set of notes ‘a remembraunce of such corne as is severall by
                itself in every close’ (across the foot of fol. 267). Various members of a Devon
                family of Cottells came up to Oxford c. 1560-1620, but none with these Christian
                names (<span class="title">AO</span>, 1:333). An early-modern Devon location for this
                manuscript would suggest it had stayed in the same locality as when it was owned by
                John Hill (note (b) mentioned above). </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Donated by <span class="persName">Henry Byam</span>: ‘ex dono Henrici Byam’ (fol. 206<span class="hi super">v</span>, lower margin, s. xvii). Cf. also ‘O god my god wherfor doste thu forsak me
                vtterly . . .’, four lines (fol. 176<span class="hi super">v</span>, upper margin, s.
                    xvii<span class="hi super">in</span>). Henry Byam came up from East Luckham
                (Somerset), matriculating at Exeter College in 1597/8 and was elected a Student of
                Christ Church in December 1599; he received four degrees: BA in 1602, MA in 1605, BD
                in 1612, and (on Charles I’s orders) DD in 1642/3. A royalist divine, he was rector
                of East Luckham from 1614 and of Selworthy from 1618 until he was sequestered in
                1647. Additionally, he was a canon of Exeter in 1632 and of Wells in 1660 and died
                in 1669 aged about 89 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 225; J. Sears McGee in <span class="title">Oxford DNB</span>, noting further books owned by Byam). His link
                with Exeter is suggestive of how he came by this book which had been in that
                diocese. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The manuscript is not recorded in the Donor’s Register so the date of its donation
                is uncertain but the evidence of its chain staple is suggestive: it in the same
                position and of the same dimensions as MS 146, which was donated in 1629. The first
                ChCh record of its presence only comes, however, with the 1676 Catalogue where it
                has the shelfmark C.3 (see Appendix I). There is a slight difference with what
                appears in the volume itself where, at the very left centre of the front pastedown,
                the relevant shelfmark is given as ‘C.2’, though the number may be written over an
                erasure. At top left of the same pastedown and at the top left of fol. 1, the New
                Library’s ‘E.5’ (see Appendix IV).</span>
