                    iv<span class="hi super">rv</span> includes a sequence of Oxford student begging
                letters and more general appeals for support; one refers to a friend ‘Iohan Doun’,
                another mentions ‘Thomas Compton’’, and a third includes ‘mon senur le Counte de
                Warwyke’. This last may be connected with the fragmentary incipit (fol. i), defaced
                from having been once pasted down, ‘¦¦et de notre cosyn Richard comite Warr’’,
                followed by an illegible reference to a dated parliament; this can only refer to
                Richard Beauchamp, earl 1401-39. His wife Elizabeth certainly had some connection to
                Oseney c. 1410; see MS 151 below. Several deeds on fol. 124<span class="hi super">v</span> record promises to make payments in Oxford. Fol. v includes a faded
                addition mentioning <span class="placeName">Eastleach</span> (Glos.).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> But other items are more dispersed. As already implied, there are a number of <span class="placeName">London</span>
                deeds, e.g. one regarding a tenement in ‘lumbardistrete’, one of the parties a
                ‘Ciuis et mercator london’’ (fol. iii). And there is a smattering of West Country
                materials, perhaps important in terms of subsequent ownership: fol. iv includes a
                complaint from the king’s vills of Weymouth and Melcombe (Dorset), and an indenture
                added at the foot of fol. v<span class="hi super">v</span> involves William Payn,
                rector of the church of ‘Clouely’ (Clovelly, N Devon; Payn was incumbent from 1362
                until his death in 1396) and John Stanton (the family of that surname held the manor
                of Clovelly from the fourteenth century; see Harry Clement,
                <span class="title">Clovelly Church and its people </span>(Braunton,
                1992), 13).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> MLGB3 assigns the book, as well as our MS 91, to <span class="orgName">Crediton (Devon), the collegiate
                church of the Holy Cross</span>. This is on the basis of two erased inscriptions which, in
                1947, Neil Ker read under ultraviolet. The first is at the top of fol. v<span class="hi super">v</span> (the last front flyleaf, with the formulary), he
                deciphered as ‘decano Crediton’; annotations through the manuscript are in the hand
                of <span class="persName">John Lyndon</span>, dean of the collegiate church of Crediton in the mid-fifteenth
                century (on whom, see MS. 91, <span class="hi smallcaps">provenance</span>). The second
                inscription, on fol. 1 (the upper margin), Ker read as ‘Guilihelmi Muggi liber ex
                dono Magistri Georgii Mason’. See further A. P. D., ‘Mugge-Mason MSS’, <span class="title">Bodleian Library Record</span>, 2 (1944), 91-92, for the descent of
                Crediton books from <span class="persName">George Mason</span>, the last Dean of the church, to <span class="persName">William Mugge</span>,
                presumably a relative of Walter Mugge, a canon of Crediton who took the Oath of
                Supremacy in 1534, as well as further comments on their descent to William Ballow.
                Ballow, an Oxfordshire man, first attended St John’s College, according to the
                donation note in the Bible he gave to that college in 1598, now their MS 48 (Ralph
                Hanna,
                <span class="title">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Western Medieval Manuscripts of St John’s College Oxford </span>(Oxford,
                2002), 66-67; Andrew Hegarty, <span class="title">A Biographical Register of St John’s
                    College, Oxford, 1555 – 1660</span>, OHS, ns 43 (Woodbridge, 2011), 189-90). He
                migrated to Christ Church, matriculating in 1587/8 and received his BA and MA in
                1591 and 1594, respectively. He was a proctor in 1604, a BD and DD in 1605 and 1613,
                respectively, and was licensed to preach in 1606. He was in the service of the Lord
                High Chamberlain in 1605, rector of Milton Bryant (Beds.) from 1604, a canon of St.
                Paul’s from 1611. He was again at Christ Church as a canon from 1615-18, when he
                died, aged about 45 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 64). He was buried in Oxford’s
                cathedral (John Le Neve, <span class="title">Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae</span>, 3 vols
                (Oxford, 1854), 2:518). </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> It was <span class="persName">William Ballow</span> who gave this manuscript to ChCh; it is presumably his hand
                that wrote in the lower margin of fol. 1: ‘Hunc codicem manuscriptum Ædi Christi in
                gratiam studiosorum ibidem Guilielmus Ballowe [over erasure: in artibus magister]
                testificandi amoris sui ergo dono dedit 5<span class="hi super">o</span>. Octobris an:
                Domini 1601’. As well as this manuscript, he donated at the same time our MS 91, and
                he later gave to ChCh 40s for book purchases, recorded in the Donors’ Register, MS
                LR 1, p. 27<span class="hi super">ab</span>, under 1614. In addition, he was an early
                donor to the Bodleian Library, giving fifteen manuscripts in 1604, the year he was
                Proctor, and five the following year; of these, five were Crediton books (R. W.
                Hunt, <span class="title">A Summary Catalogue of the Western Manuscripts in the
                    Bodleian Library at Oxford</span> 1 (Oxford, 1953), 89 (nos 392-405) and 91 (nos
                466-69)). For Ballow’s son, Thomas, as a donor to Christ Church, see our MS.

                sign of it having had an earlier shelfmark and, indeed, it is absent from the 1676
