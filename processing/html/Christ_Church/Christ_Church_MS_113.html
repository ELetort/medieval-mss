                        There are two recent and independent reconstructions of his career: Maria Gabriella

                (heavily speckled with a pattern of three white dots), penwork and floral borders
                head and foot, that at the foot with a blazon. The arms are ‘barry or and
                sable, on a chief gules a rose argent’; Chambers (172) notes the suggestion that
                they are the coat-of-arms of the <span class="persName">Corboli (or Calboli) family of Forlì</span>. At the

                 The scribe identifies
                himself in the colophon but names the place of production only by the initial ‘F’.
                It is on the basis of the illumination that this manuscript can be firmly localised
                to Ferrara, a city which he is known to have been resident at several points of his
                life (Chambers, 175-76). If the recent attribution of the arms is correct, the
                manuscript may have been intended to be transported to Forlì. Certainly, this and
                its companion volume remained in north-east Italy in their early years, as is shown
                by the pentrials (s. xv<span class="hi super">ex</span>) at fol. 158<span class="hi super">v</span>, which include a repeated couplet in Italian ‘Chi
                serue a Dio cum purita de core | Vive contento &amp; poi saluato More’, and the
                address, ‘Magnifico et generoso Domino ant Contarino’, suggesting it may have been
                present in Venetian lands, by someone seeking to ingratiate themselves with the
                patrician <span class="persName">Contarini family</span> (the Antonio is presumably not the man who was to be
                patriarch of Venice, 1509-1524, considering this is an address to a non-cleric).
                There is also, at the preceding recto, the motto ‘virtutem pueri primis discatis ab
                annis’ in a humanist cursive which also appears in our MS 114 (s. xv<span class="hi super">2</span>).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Donated by <span class="persName">John Moore</span>. The gift is recorded by Edward Smallwell at fol. ii: ‘D. D.
                Joannes Moore, S. T. P. hujusce Ædis Canonicus et Sub-Decanus An. 1766’; Smallwell
                also entered it in the Donors’ Register, MS LR 1, for 1766 (p. 249<span class="hi super">b</span>) where Moore gave ‘Virgilii Codicem Manu Matthei
                Domini Herculani de Vulterris ss An. 1456 2 Voll. 4<span class="hi super">o</span>’,
                i.e. both this volume and the next. Moore matriculated at Pembroke College in 1745,
                and received degrees of BA, MA, BD, and DD in 1748, 1751, and 1763 (both degrees in
                divinity), respectively. He was canon of Christ Church from 1763, eventually bishop
                of Bangor (1775-83) and archbishop of Canterbury (1783-1805). He died in 1805, aged
                75 (<span class="abbr">AO<span class="hi italic">mod</span>

                in <span class="title">Oxford DNB</span>). Edward Smallwell also wrote the New Library
                shelfmark above the donation note at fol. ii: ‘C.1.’ (See Appendix IV).</span>
