                              <span class="signatures">There are two sets of signatures, the first in the normal bottom right of the

                    in the first half of each quire, but most cut away: in this system, quires 2-8 =
                    a-g, and h is assigned to the inserted bifolium of quire 8 (on fol. 54, both ‘g
                    iij’ and below it, ‘3 7’ in the crayon used for rules). In addition, a fuller
                    set of signatures, although still very frequently cut away, appears in the upper
                    right corner, composed of arabic numerals for both leaf and gathering; in this
                    system, quires 2-9 = 1-8 (roman v appears on quire 5, first folio [fol. 29], f
                    three times in quire 7, and ?g three times in quire 8). The signature ‘3 3’ on
                    both fols 23 and 27 suggests that signatures appeared on both halves of bifolia.</span>
                    At the top of fol. 56, the first leaf of the inserted bifolium, a partly cutaway
                    instruction for binding: ‘mediu&lt;m ...&gt; x’.
                    <span class="collation-p">Fols 56-57 form an inserted bifolium, signed as such. This presents the end of
                    the chapter ‘de moralibus virtutibus’, with the following chapter beginning on
                    fol. 58. This presentation may reflect a mid-production change of plan linked to
                    the decision to provide the double, full-opening miniature on fols 59<span class="hi superscript">v</span>-60. This illustration, in turn, is succeeded by
                            the page, almost entirely devoted to illuminations, opening the following
                            chapter ‘de preliis regis et eius prudencijs in bellis habendis et de militum
                            exercicijs et alterius armate gentis’ (fol. 60<span class="hi superscript">v</span>).</span>
                              <span class="collation-p">Certainly indicative of some change of programme is the opening of the volume.

                    extensive references, identifies artists in our codex with a number of books
                    beyond those held in Oxford, including her nos 86 and 88 (2:94-98), as well as
                    Cambridge: Gonville and Caius College, MS 257/662. More recently, Michael
                    Michael has proposed that the same artist was responsible from the fragmentary
                    Apocalypse that is now BL, MS Add. 38842, with which he also associates Oxford:
                    All Souls, MS 7 and Dublin: Trinity College, MS 35 (see his entry at Frances

                    argues (‘Iconography’, 37) that the miniatures were executed in two separate
                    stages between the invasion of England by Isabella of France in September 1326
                    and the death of Edward II in September 1327.</p>

                     A red velvet chemise, embroidered in gold
                    thread (shield-shaped designs, perhaps intended to receive embroidered armorial
                    material), identified by Giles Barber, <span class="title">Textile and Embroidered
                        Bindings</span>, Bodleian Library Picture Books special series 2 (1971), 4, as
                    Italian, s. xv, and illustrated as his plate 1. The chemise is lined with tawed
                    skin, to which are sewn pink leather pouches to take the boards of the binding,
                    which are white leather over wood. The boards sewn on seven thongs, as in
                    Pollard’s Figures 4 and 5, s. xiv. Although the embroidered covering may be of
                    Italian manufacture, the binding as a whole does not appear to have originated
                    in Italy. Indeed, Frederick Bearman, ‘The Origins and Significance of Two Late
                    Medieval Textile Chemise Bookbindings in the Walters Art Gallery’, <span class="title">The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery</span>, 54 (1996), 163-87
                    (166) proposes that it is ‘more appropriately understood as an English
                    fifteenth-century(?) textile chemise binding, made of contemporary red velvet
                    with embroidered decoration, possibly of Italian manufacture’. For a discussion
                    of the binding in a wider context, see Jan Storm van Leeuwen, ‘The Well-Shirted
                    Bookbinding. On chemise bindings and Hülleneinbände’ in T. Croiset van Uchelen

                    <span class="foreign">terminus post quem non</span> for the
                    binding, in as much as a note has been added at the top of the final flyleaf
                    (‘nisi domine / illust[rissime] Reverendissime’; fol. 81) in a secretary script
                    of the mid-fifteenth century. A further suggestion may be added: it may perhaps
                    have been at the point of providing the chemise that pieces of thin material
                    were stitched to the top of several folios, in order to protect the
                    illumination; James records (xxxvii) six locations where these ‘(blue) silk
                    guards’ remain (fol. 14<span class="hi super">v</span>, 27, 43, 46<span class="hi super">v</span>, 50, 59<span class="hi super">v</span>); on one
                    other occasion, some of the thread remains (fol. 24), while in nine instances,
                    the holes for the thread alone survive (fol. 1, 3, 4, 8, 18, 21, 37, 44, 51). On

                    of kingship presented to Edward by Milemete, King’s Clerk (illustrated in the

                    epistle that forms ch. 2). The second manuscript, formerly Holkham Hall, MS 458,
                    is now BL, MS Add. 47680, a copy of the <span class="title">Secretum

                  <span class="provenance">The precise timing of the production of the manuscript has evoked discussion and
                    it has even been proposed that Milemete originally began the work ‘with Edward
                    II in mind and later modified [it] for his son’: Libby Karlinger Escobedo, ‘“To
                    the Illustrious Lord Edward:” A Re-evaluation of Audience and Patronage in the
                    Milemete Treatise and the Companion <span class="title">Secretum Secretorum</span>’,

                    NY, 2011). That argument is unconvincing. It draws attention to the alterations
                    made to the text in our manuscript, though those interventions are subtle and
                    often merely grammatical improvements (eg., fol. 5<span class="hi super">v</span>,
                        ‘super<span class="hi italic">esse</span>’ presumably written over ‘superest’; here
                    and in subsequent quotations italics signify corrections). The most significant
                    changes occur in the second textual section, the ‘Epistola allectiva’ that
                    begins on fol. 8<span class="hi super">v</span>, which opens ‘Excellentissimo et

                    clericus reverenciam et honorem ^ac^ fidele de<span class="hi italic">vocionis
                        obsequium seipsum</span> et...’ (note that Milemete’s name itself has not been
                    altered). The invocation to the king must refer either to Edward II before his
                    son was invested with the duchy of Aquitaine in 1325 or to Edward III after his
                    father’s deposition. Which Edward is meant is revealed later in the same section
                    at fol. 10 where the recipient is addressed: ‘quod vos domine
                    <span class="hi italic">rex dux </span>et comes filius primogenitus
                    et heres illustris domini nostri Regis <span class="hi italic">nuper</span> anglie...’.
                    The recipient is clearly Edward of Windsor, though the changes suggest the text
                    may have been drafted before the overthrow of his father in the autumn of 1326
                    and then not revised with complete consistency at the point of the construction
                    of the manuscript, only to be made consistent by the scribe at the final stage.
                    This scenario can also apply to the heraldic programme, conceptualised in Edward
                    II’s reign for a manuscript to be given to the king’s school-age son, and not
                    fully updated in the changed circumstances following the deposition. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">The question then becomes who might have encouraged and supported Milemete in
                    the production of this manuscript and of the <span class="title">Secretum</span>.
                    The answer favoured by Michael Michael and others is that it was Edward III’s
                    mother, <span class="persName">Isabella</span>, who herself appears in the illumination: on this manuscript in
                    the context of her patronage of books, see Anne Rudloff Stanton, ‘Isabelle of
                    France and her Manuscripts’ in Kathleen Nolan ed.,
                    <span class="title">Capetian Women </span>(Basingstoke, 2003),
                    225-52 (238-40).</span>
                  <span class="provenance">As well as the copy made by Milemete, there was another manuscript including the
                        <span class="title">Secretum</span>, on this occasion in French translation,
                    made for Edward in these years; it is now Paris: Bibliothèque nationale de
                    France, MS fr. 571 and was given to Edward by Philippa of Hainault as part of
                    her betrothal gift; see Sandler, no. 96 (2:103-5), Michael Michael, ‘A
                    manuscript wedding gift from Philippa of Hainault to Edward III’, <span class="title">Burlington Magazine</span>, 127
                    (1985), 582-99, and id., ‘Towards a Hermeneutics of the Manuscript: the physical
                    and metaphysical journeys of Paris, BnF, MS. fr. 571’ in Peregrine Horden ed.,
                    <span class="title">Freedom of Movement in the Middle Ages: proceedings of the 2003 Harlaxton Symposium </span>(Donington,
                    2007), 305-17; Michael associates this book with the Statutes of England in
                    Cambridge MA: Harvard Law School, MS 12. Also contemporary is the small psalter,
                    London: Dr Williams’s Library, MS Anc. 6, with arms of Edward and Philippa,
                    described by Ker, <span class="title">MMBL</span>, 1:428-29; and Sandler, no. 74
                    (2:81-82); Lynda Dennison associates that book with the central ‘Queen Mary
                    Psalter’ atelier, ‘An Illuminator of the Queen Mary Psalter Group: the Ancient 6
                    Master’, <span class="title">The Antiquaries Journal</span>, 66 (1986), 287-314. See

                  <span class="provenance">The high honour in which this manuscript continued to be held in the century
                    after its royal recipient’s death is reflected by the luxury binding it received
                    – more usual for a religious text – and the protection provided for the
                    illumination. It received less kind attention from a doodler who, on two
                    occasions, copied a detail of the illumination (fol. i<span class="hi super">v</span>, 5). Its whereabouts in these years are unknown and, in the
                    sixteenth century (as Thomas Hearne was later to note), it escaped the
                    attentions of the bibliographers, John Leland and John Bale. That is not to say
                    the manuscript was totally ignored by antiquaries: there is a set of
                    seventeenth-century annotations identifying the people mentioned by their
                    coats-of-arms (fol. i<span class="hi super">v</span>, 1<span class="hi super">v</span>, 2, 2<span class="hi super">v</span>, 4<span class="hi super">v</span>,
                        6<span class="hi super">v</span>, 9, 10?, 11?, 11<span class="hi super">v</span>, 19, 31).</span>
                  <span class="provenance">At fol. i, the donation to Christ Church is recorded: ‘Bibliothecae Ædis Christi
                    Oxon Librum hunc donavit <span class="persName">Gulielmus Carpender Parochiae de Stanton super Vagam in
                    Agro Herefordensi Rector Ejusdem Ædis</span> olim Alumnus A.D. 1707’. Noted in the
                    Donors’ Register, MS LR 1, p. 230<span class="hi super">b</span> (the column
                    headed 1706 but the donation recorded as 1707): ‘Gualteri de Mellimet Librum de
                    nobilitatibus sapientijs et prudentijs Regum MS’, along with the gift of our MS
                    125 (on which, see below). Carpender, a Herefordshire man, was at Christ Church
                    through the Commonwealth period, as a Pauline exhibitioner 1647-53, receiving
                    degrees of BA and MA in 1649/50 and 1652 respectively; he was the Whyte
                    Professor of Moral Philosophy 1657-60. He was vicar of Staunton-upon-Wye from
                    1660 and of Calveton (Bucks.) from 1661 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 240). The
                    brace of manuscripts he gave perhaps formed a testamentary bequest, since
                    Carpender should have been at least 65 in 1707.</span>
                  <span class="provenance">In fact, the manuscript was within the curtilage of Christ Church at least a
                    little before the specified year of donation. It was inspected at Christ Church
                    by Thomas Hearne (who recognised that it had a twin in Milemete’s <span class="title">Secretum</span> manuscript); his extensive account, <span class="title">Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne</span>, ed. C. E.
                    Doble, 11 vols (Oxford, 1885-1921), 1:298/27-8, 299/1-37 appears under the date
                    of 25<span class="hi super">th</span> October 1706. 
                      
                      In addition, Milemete was to
                    receive an entry in Thomas Tanner,
                    <span class="title">Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica </span>(London,
                    1748), 527, where our manuscript is described as ‘codex hic extat pulcherrime
                    exaratus in bibliotheca doct. Aldrich, aedis Christi decani apud Oxonienses’.
                    That phrasing suggests that Tanner was writing not when he was a canon of Christ
                    Church (1724-35) but rather before Aldrich’s death in 1710. Armed with these two
                    pieces of information, we may hypothesise that the manuscript was in the hands
                    of the dean before it was placed in the library. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">Its arrival in Oxford was not quite the end of the manuscript’s travels: at the
                    lower board there is a small and slightly smudged note where the last letters
                    are frustratingly hard to decipher; James reconstructed it as ‘1712/13 March
                        4<span class="hi super">th</span> returnd tynlly(?)’ but the last letters may
                    be ‘by Hine (followed by a long downward flourish)’.</span>
                  <span class="provenance">The former New Library shelfmark ‘E.11’ appears at the front pastedown, at fol.
                        i<span class="hi super">v</span> and fol. 1 lower margin (see Appendix IV).
                    This refers to its position in the Archives but, in the later nineteenth
                    century, it (along with MSS 101 and 178) was displayed in a glass cabinet in the
                    Upper Library: Thompson, 247. The manuscript is now fully digitised and
                    available on the Library’s website.</span>
