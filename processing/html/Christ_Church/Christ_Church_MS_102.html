                123 below; those two, but not this manuscript, appear in the list of manuscripts at
                de Haas and Hall, xxiii-vii. A substantial number of stubs (at least nine) precede
                the incipit, which occurs on the leaf signed ‘C iiij’; the running title here
                identifies the writ as ‘Quare impedit’. The text breaks off in a section with
                running title ‘de manucapcione’.</li>

                fol. 124), ‘De posteissenia’ (after fol. 130), ‘De recordo et processu mittendo’

                    112<span class="hi super">v</span>-113). The care taken to provide that foliation
                suggests the volume originally ended with an index (cf our MS 103). Comparison of
                what we have with Holdsworth’s listing of the contents of Oxford: St Johns, MS 256
                (as cited above) hints at the amount lost at the beginning – the first five
                ‘capitula’ – and the end – two further capitula. The opening may have been preceded
                by further ancillary material: the few letters of text visible on the recto of the
                very first stub are in English, while the verso is blank, suggesting that the <span class="title">Registrum</span> was preceded by another short text. </li>

                 There is no definite
                internal evidence to indicate this volume’s early history. The text, as mentioned,
                is provided with several blank spaces but there are only three additions, all placed
                in the bottom margin and not providing any clear suggestion of a geographical
                origin: fol. 4<span class="hi super">v</span> (Westminster), 49<span class="hi super">v</span> (no place stated), 109<span class="hi super">v</span> (to an unidentified
                Earl of Warwick); the first two of these are in the scribal hand, and the third may
                also be, though it is in a more cursive version. The only later added material is a
                single note: ‘And for al that indeed the feare of his d|dreame being laid aside he
                cals unto him’ (the blank fol. 82<span class="hi super">v</span>, s. xvi<span class="hi super">2/4</span>).</span>

                352/8): ‘Registrum Brevium &amp;c. Imperfect’. That provenance is corroborated by
                the bookplate, and explains the manuscript’s absence from the New Library Catalogue
