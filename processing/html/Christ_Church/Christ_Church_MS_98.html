                i/2:210-11 discusses the illumination in detail; she proposes that it ‘is a hitherto
                unrecorded instance of collaboration between the <span class="persName">Saint-Omer artist</span> and the <span class="persName">Douai
                painter</span>’, taking the first to be responsible for
                <span class="foreign">Beatus</span> initial at fol. 8 (drawing a
                parallel with Paris: Bibliothèque d’Arsenal, MS 3516) and the latter, to whom she
                also attributes Brussels: Bibliothèque Royale, MS 9391 and Valenciennes:
                Bibliothèque municipale, MS 838, for all other interventions. She speculates that
                her Douai painter may have taken over after the death of the St Omer artist. She
                places the work to ‘c. 1275-1285’, taking 1290 as the
                <span class="foreign">terminus post quem non</span> since an obit to

                (70) and plate xl (fol. 7); Scott, 1:76 n23 (referring to 1:55) apparently considers

                stamped: in an inner rectangle corner-pieces and an armorial centrepiece, providing
                the arms of John Whitgift as archbishop of Canterbury, 1583-1604, using his Stamp 3
                as defined by the British Armorial Binding database [last accessed 15<span class="hi super">th</span> December 2015]. Sewn on five thongs. In the act of
                re-binding for Whitgift, the folios were cut down, with some loss of illumination at
                the top of fol. 7; the fore-edges of the leaves were also gilded. Those fore-edges
                have painted onto them ‘MS F 12’. Pastedowns modern paper, a ChCh bookplate on the
                front pastedown. At the front, two modern paper flyleaves and one modern vellum one;
                at the rear, one modern paper flyleaf (132). On the medieval binding this replaced,

                  <span class="provenance"> An early learned attempt to reconstruct this
                manuscript’s early history is provided by a letter, kept with the manuscript, dated
                    15<span class="hi super">th</span> August 1902, and from the musicologist and
                scholar of liturgy H(enry) M(arriott) Bannister (1854-1919). He proposes a St Bertin
                origin and states ‘I believe it to be older than is stated in Dr Kitchin’s catalogue
                [saec. xiv. vel xv.]. The terminus a quo, as evidenced by the Kalendar, is AD. 1255
                (canonization of St. Clara), and the absence of St. Louis the King (canonized in
                1297) ... usually suggests the 13<span class="hi super">th</span> century. And this is
                borne out by the added obit of our Queen Eleanor (†1290); as she was buried at
                Westminster and had no special French connexion, I think that the ms. must have got
                to London before the beginning of the 14<span class="hi super">th</span> century.’
                These perspicacious comments can be augmented and revised. The calendar certainly
                points toward production for use in St Omer or its neighbourhood, through the
                inclusion of saints related to the abbey found at Sithiu (present St Omer) by Omer
                (d. 667) himself and whose first abbot, Bertin (d. 698) gave it the name by which is
                known, and with Erkembode (d. 742) a later abbot.</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The date of the manuscript’s arrival in England cannot be stated with as much
                certainty as Bannister attempted. Alison Stones suggests (i/2:210) that the obit for
                Eleanor, wife of Edward I (27 November) is contemporaneous with the text and may
                have been added in France, since she was Countess of Ponthieu. While this should be
                rejected – the wording, ‘Obitus Elianore consortae Edward regis Ang¦¦’, emphasises
                her English connexions and appears to be by an English hand (?s. xiv<span class="hi super">in</span>) – the evidence cannot confirm an early move across
                the Channel. More revealing of its early use are the two additions to the calendar,
                both relating to Saint Dominic (noted by Archer, 139); Stones points out that the
                date of the second feast (5 August) suggests a French origin as, in England, the
                feast fell on 4 August. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> If, then, its earliest use is connected with friars in France, it seems it was in
                England by the early fourteenth century and, certainly, by the fifteenth century, it
                was in non-religious English ownership. There is a set of additions to the calendar
                in secretary, all associated with <span class="persName">Sir Edmund Rede the younger of Boarstall, Bucks.
                (1413-89)</span>. These extend chronologically from the death of his father, also Edmund,
                in 1430 (8 October) to a note of his being knighted in 1465 (the foot of the page
                for May). Included, under 21 November, is a notice of Rede’s marriage to Agnes,
                daughter of Sir John Cottesmore of Baldwin Brightwell, Oxon. (1435); Cottesmore was
                lord chief justice, his death noted under 30 August (1439). For further biographical
                particulars on Rede, see <span class="title">The Boarstall Cartulary</span>, ed. H. E.
                Salter, OHS 88 (1930), ix-x; Josiah C. Wedgwood and Anne D. Holt, <span class="title">History of Parliament: Biographies of Members of the Commons House
                    1439-1509</span> (London, 1936), 711-12, and White Kennett, <span class="title">Parochial Antiquities Attempted in the History of Ambrosden . . .</span>, rev.
                edn, 2 vols (Oxford, 1818), 2:313-407 passim (with material tracing the lordship of
                Boarstall from Rede to 1634 at 407).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Rede’s will, printed Salter, 286-95, provides an extremely extensive account of his
                library, at least two dozen books receiving mention. This manuscript was probably
                among the books Rede left his grandson and heir William, which include ‘duo
                psalteria mea cum duobus clapsis de argento et deauratum pounced cum capitibus
                unicornuum’ (Archer (140) is surely wrong in identifying this medium quarto volume
                with the ‘psalterium valde minimum’ mentioned). Salter notes that this was the
                device of the Jameses, Rede’s mother Christine’s family (cf. her obit, 28 March
                1435, in the calendar); this evidence of its binding prior to the late sixteenth
                century may help us surmise the ownership in the generations immediately before it
                reached Edmund Rede’s hands.</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Among surviving Rede books, in addition to the Boarstall Cartulary (in private
                hands), are BL, MSS Cotton Nero C.iii (Nicholas Upton) and Harl. 3490 (an outsized
                    <span class="title">Confessio amantis</span>), both mentioned in the will. See A. I.
                Doyle, ‘English Books In and Out of Court from Edward III to Henry VII’,
                Scattergood-Sherborne, 163-81 at 175-76; Kate Harris in Jeremy Griffiths and Derek
                Pearsall ed., <span class="title">Book Production and Publishing in Britain
                    1375-1475</span> (Cambridge, 1989), 168, and Derek Pearsall, ‘The Rede (Boarstall)
                Gower: British Library, MS Harley 3490’, Griffiths FS, 87-99.</span>
                  <span class="provenance">Our knowledge of the subsequent history of the book is incomplete. There is a
                signature ‘Jesus <span class="persName">Ben’ Brasgerdle</span>’ (fol. 131<span class="hi super">v</span>, s.
                xv/xvi), presumably an owner after the volume left the Rede family. By the end of
                the sixteenth century, as shown by the presence of the arms on the binding, this
                manuscript was in the collection of <span class="persName">John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury</span>. The
                shelfmark at the fore-edge, however, is not (Prof. James Carley tells us) in a style
                used in his library, and it also does not come from ChCh, where the
                seventeenth-century collection did not run to a set of ‘F’ manuscripts. So, this
                shelf-mark is evidence for intermediate ownership between the archbishop and its
                present location.</span>
                  <span class="provenance">It is unclear precisely when this manuscript arrived at ChCh: it does not contain a
                note of donation nor is it recorded in the Donors’ Register (MS LR 1). The earliest
                internal evidence for ChCh’s ownership of the volume is the New Library shelfmark
                ‘E.12’, written by Edward Smallwell at the front pastedown and the foot of fol. 1.
                Another book once belonging to Archbishop Whitgift, a printed Book of Common Prayer
                (London: Christopher Barker, [1583?]) with his annotations, came to ChCh and is held
                as MS 336; it was part of the bequest of another archbishop of Canterbury, William
                Wake. This Psalter, however, is not listed in Wake’s schedule (MS 352/8), and,
                indeed, its presence in the New Library catalogue – which excludes the Wake
                collection (see Appendix IV) – demonstrates that it must have arrived by a different
                route. In fact, the 1676 catalogue has an entry for ‘Psalmi etiam latine 4<span class="hi super">o</span>’ and, of the manuscripts now <span class="foreign">in
                    situ</span>, this is the only possible match (Appendix I, <span class="hi bold">[23]</span>). Given the Donors’ Register is fairly full for the Restoration
                period, as it is for the 1610s, and considering the other evidence we have, the most
                plausible period for our manuscript’s arrival would be the second quarter or the
                very middle of the seventeenth century. Perhaps its exit from the institutional
                library which had a shelfmark added to the fore-edge was related to the upheavals
                caused by the Interregnum and it came to this redoubt of royalism for safe-keeping;
                this coincided with a time when the entries in the Donor’s Register were fitful.
                Why, however, this Psalter should then fail to be recorded in the Old Archives
                catalogue (see Appendix II) is a quandary. </span>
