                     It is not possible to
                    reconstruct the early history of this volume. There is a name cancelled at fol.
                    iv, and two erased ownership inscriptions at fol. 189<span class="hi super">v</span> (following the explicit). From the seventeenth century, there is a
                    name ‘<span class="persName">John Rakeby</span>[?]’ at fol. vi. The first fully identifiable owner writes his
                    name at fol. v: ‘Æ Lanc<span class="hi super">t</span> lee his Booke 1671 | <span class="persName">Eldred
                    lancelott lee</span>’. He has also signed on fol. 190, above an erased ownership
                    inscription; and on fol. 191. On fol. 190, he follows his name with ‘qui ego hoc
                    petiuit tam pro regni quam pro seipso sequitur ver&lt;...&gt; et desendit &lt;
                    &gt;‘, the remainder abraded away. In addition, at fol. 189<span class="hi super">v</span>, he writes ‘Rogerus hope vnus clericorum francisci
                    wythini in officio placitorum’, and ‘Iohannes Yonge seruiens &lt;the rest
                    overwritten with flourishes&gt;’ (the latter’s name also at fol. 190<span class="hi super">v</span>). Eldred Lancelot Lee (Eldred presumably after the
                    eleventh-century bishop of Worcester in whose diocese the Lee family’s ancestral
                    home of Coton Hall, Shropshire, sat) is a known legal clerk from the reign of
                    Charles II: J. S. Cockburn, ‘Seventeenth-Century Clerks of Assize – Some
                    Anonymous Members of the Legal Profession’, <span class="title">The American
                        Journal of Legal History</span>, 13 (1969), 315-332 (328). The notes
                    mentioning Hope and Yonge appear to be intended as aide-memoires concerning
                    legal staff; that concerning Hope mentions the Tory judge Sir Francis Wythens
                    (on whom see Eveline Cruickshanks in B. D. Henning,
                    <span class="title">The History of Parliament: the House of Commons, 1660-1690 </span>(Cambridge,
                    1983), 3 vols, 3:783-84 and Stuart Handley in <span class="title">Oxford
                    DNB</span>). In 1686, Wythens and Eldred Lancelot Lee sat together on the

                    <span class="title">Calendar of Assize Records: Kent Indictments, Charles II, 1676-88 </span>(Woodbridge,
                    1997), 243 (no. 1261). It is reasonable to imagine that Lee carried this
                    pocket-sized <span class="foreign">registrum brevium</span> with him.</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The earliest indication of ChCh ownership is the note: ‘The Dean at the request
                    of D<span class="hi super">r</span> Wheeler one of the Chaplains of Christ Church
                    deposited this Book in the Library June 20 1822’ (fol. ix). The Dean in question
                    was <span class="persName">Charles H. Hall</span>; he matriculated at Christ Church in 1779, and received four
                    degrees: his BA in 1783, MA in 1786, BD in 1794, and DD in 1800. He was a canon
                    of Christ Church from 1799, the Regius Professor of Divinity 1807-9, and Dean
                    from 1809 until 1824, when he moved to the deanery of Durham; he died in 1827
                    aged 70 (<span class="title">AOmod</span>, 587; J. F. A. Mason in <span class="title">Oxford DNB</span>). Charles Wheeler was chaplain of Christ Church 1820-31 and
                    died in 1835, aged 38 (<span class="title">AOmod</span>, 1534). The volume includes
                    the old ChCh shelfmark ‘Arch Sup C.25’ (pencil, fol. iv<span class="hi super">v</span>), suggesting that this was added to the end of the C section which,
                    in the New Library Catalogue, ended at 24 (see Appendix IV).</span>
