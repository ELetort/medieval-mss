                three-line alternate red and blue lombards with flourishing of the other colour
                (six-line in both colours with flourishing in both at the openings of the Nocturns);

                     <p class="decoNote"> The single piece of surviving illumination is ascribed to the early Oxford
                illuminator, <span class="persName">William de Brailes</span>. Nigel Morgan first made the identification, <span class="title">Early Gothic Manuscripts [I] 1190-1250</span> (London, 1982), 115,
                where he listed the manuscript among six previously unnoticed examples of de Brailes
                collaborating with other hands, apparently members of his workshop.</p>
                     <p class="decoNote"> William de Brailes’s work was first collected from six manuscripts by Sydney C.
                Cockerell, <span class="title">The Work of W. de Brailes An English Illuminator of the
                    Thirteenth Century</span>, Roxburghe Club (Cambridge, 1930). To these MSS, Hans
                Swarzenski, ‘Unknown Bible Pictures by W. de Brailes and Some Notes on Early English
                Bible Illustration’, <span class="title">Journal of the Walters Art Gallery</span>, 1
                (1938), 55-70, added a seventh, Baltimore, John Walters Art Gallery, MS 106. Graham
                Pollard, ‘William de Brailes’, <span class="title">Bodleian Library Record,</span> 5
                (1955), 202-9, identified de Brailes with an Oxford book-trade community in Catte
                Street. Claire Donovan, <span class="title">The de Brailes Hours</span> (London, 1991),
                includes an extensive list of books produced in Oxford in the thirteenth century (de
                Brailes items are nos 15-21 [202-3]) but omits this volume. Other Bibles illuminated
                by de Brailes include BodL, MS Lat. bibl. e.7 (<span class="foreign">olim</span> Dyson
                Perrins); and Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 350/567. There is, of
                course, a pleasing coincidence that a manuscript associated with William de Brailes
                should now reside in a library whose central south window overlooks the transept of
                what was once the priory of St Frideswide, for whose chapter house de Brailes may
                have designed the paintings on the vault: Margart Rickert,

                of these are likely to date from after the manuscript’s arrival in ChCh, with that
                at Watson 5 resulting from the re-organisation of the library in or after 1614, and
                that at Watson 4 being witness to earlier chaining practice (see Appendix I).

                 This Bible’s calendar is
                suggestive of its early use. As it lacks any reference to St Francis, we can assume
                it was not originally intended for Franciscan use, in contrast to BL, MS Harl. 2813,
                which Peter Kidd relates to de Brailes and to the Oxford convent: ‘A Franciscan
                Bible illuminated in the Style of William de Brailes’, <span class="title">Electronic
                    British Library Journal</span>, sn (2007), article 8, freely available on-line
                [last accessed 14<span class="hi super">th</span> August 2012]. On the other hand, the
                early addition of the feast of St Anthony of Padua suggests it soon entered that
                ambit. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Our manuscript received early attention from readers, who left their mark both in
                annotations (heavy in Song of Songs and in John, as well as Apocalypse) and in
                drawings (a monstrous serpent in plummet at fol. 165, and human faces in pen at fol.
                178 and 179. There are also later annotations, including a manicula (fol. 32, 33,
                197; s. xv?) and, in the first folios especially, a set of fifteenth-century
                corrections (eg. fol. 5, 7 – 10, 12<span class="hi super">v</span>, 43, 66, 88). None
                of these, though, hints at its ownership. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The earliest definite information is provided by the inscriptions ‘<span class="persName">Willelmus
                Skipwyth</span>’ in red (fol. 180, upper margin), s. xv<span class="hi super">3/4</span>;
                ‘Will(el)mvs skipwith’ in red capitals above the incipit (fol. 4); he also signs (as
                ‘Armiger’) 14 lines below the explicit (fol. 356<span class="hi super">rb</span>,
                covering two verses of added text (b)), as well as writing his surname in the outer
                margin at the opening of the Psalter (fol. 165). At least three William Skipwiths
                might have owned the book. One, from Habrough (Lincs.), was an MP for Norwich
                1463-65 and died 1487; see Josiah C. Wedgwood and Anne D. Holt, <span class="title">History of Parliament: Biographies of Members of the Commons House
                    1439-1509</span> (London, 1936), 733. The second, from Calthorpe (Lincs.), was
                knighted 1447/51 and died 1483. The education of a third would explain how this
                Oxford book came into his hands: of York diocese, he was a BA of Oxford, there in
                1446 but, the following year appointed a chaplain of Eton College (<span class="title">BRUO</span>, 3:1711); there is, though, no sign of whether he was ‘armiger’.
                Three families of the name, their connection with these candidates unclear, were
                barons in the fifteenth century (Charles Kingsford
                <span class="foreign">sub </span>Sir William Skipwith (fl. 1380) in
                old <span class="title">DNB</span>).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Whichever Skipwith it was, he is perhaps responsible for a further addition: ‘Domine
                labia mea aperies et os meum a’ and more fully below ‘. . . meum annunciabit laudem
                tuam Deus in adiutorium meum in’ (fol. 356<span class="hi super">rb</span> beneath the
                signature, s. xv).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The next indication of ownership represents the eventual donor to the College:
                ‘Liber Guilielmi Prichardi ex dono auunculi sui Dauidis Lewis Doctoris in
                iurisprudentia Admiralis curiæ supremi iudicis’ (fol. 1, upper margin). <span class="persName">David Lewis,
                of Abergavenney, Monmouthshire</span>, was educated at All Souls College, graduating BCL
                and DCL in 1540 and 1548, respectively; he was a fellow there from 1541. He was
                principal of New Inn Hall 1545-48 and the first principal of Jesus College 1571-72.
                A lawyer from 1548, he was (as the inscription indicates) judge of the High Court of
                the Admiralty, a post he held from 1558 to 1575 (thus providing the time limits
                within which his gift of this codex to Prichard must have occurred). Lewis died in
                1584 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 905; T. G. Watkin in <span class="hi italic">Oxford
                    DNB</span>).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The inscription of donation, written in the same hand as the preceding note, reads:
                ‘Liber Ecclesiæ Christi ex dono <span class="persName">Guilielmi Prichardi</span> ibidem alumni et in artibus
                Magistrj’ (fol. 1, lower margin). Prichard, like his uncle a Monmouthshire man,
                matriculated at Jesus College in 1581, and was at Christ Church by 1585; he received
                the degree of MA in 1588 and was a Proctor in 1595. He was vicar of Abergavenny in
                1589 and of Caerwent (Mons.) 1601, rector of Ewelme (Oxon.) 1606-29, and canon of
                Salisbury and St Paul’s from 1620. He died in 1629 aged about 66; most of his
                benefactions went to Jesus College (<span class="title">AO</span>, 1211). The donation
                of this volume is datable to between 1600 and 1614: the <span class="foreign">terminus
                    ante quem non</span> is provided by the fact it does not appear in James, <span class="title">Ecloga</span>, and the <span class="foreign">terminus post quem non</span>
                by the evidence of its two chain-staples: (see binding). </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The Library Donors’ Book for 1614, pp. 26<span class="hi super">b</span>-27<span class="hi super">a</span>, records a later gift from Prichard, comprising £5
                (with which the library bought five books) and two printed books. Both are <span class="foreign">in situ</span>. One, recorded as a ‘Biblja Galljca. fol: 1565’ is
                NB.2.1 (Paris: Henri Estienne, 1565), with a note of Prichard’s donation, not in his
                hand. The other, recorded as ‘Durandus super sententias Parisijs Anno 1556 fol.’,
                must surely be the library’s G.3.3.10 – must surely because, despite a difference of
                date from that recorded in the Donors’ Book (the volume was published by Charlotte
                Guillard and Guillaume Desbois in 1550) and despite not having a note of Prichard’s
                donation, it does have on the title-page the inscription ‘Liber Davidis Lewes legum
                Doctoris Juris nautici in regno Angliae pro 7s comparatus’; it presumably, then,
                passed from Lewis to Prichard as did this manuscript. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> This volume has, at the front pastedown, two former ChCh shelfmarks, that of the
                1676 Catalogue, ‘B.1’, cancelled (see Appendix I), followed by the New Library’s
                ‘E.9’ (see Appendix IV); the latter is repeated in the lower margin of fol. 1.</span>
