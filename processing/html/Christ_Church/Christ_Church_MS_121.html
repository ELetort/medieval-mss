                five anecdotes at the head and at the end (with some disordering of the tales at the
                end), and a comparable total of 102 stories (213-15). Also similar at incipit and

                the chain-staple does not accord with ChCh practice (on this generally, see
                Introduction, ‘Christ Church, From Foundation’, and see Appendix I), the mark is
                presumably evidence of this manuscript’s place in an institutional collection. By
                the third quarter of the sixteenth century, it appears to be circulating in private
                hands: there are several notes many erased, some only <span class="foreign">probationes
                    pennae</span> – written, usually upside down in the lower margin. They are
                contributions from perhaps fifteen individuals, and they provide a series of names,
                including ‘<span class="persName">Henrys mywyn</span>’ (fol. 17), and ‘<span class="persName">John Stoodlinge</span>’ (fol. 72<span class="hi super">v</span>); at fol. 114<span class="hi super">v</span> a schoolboy
                manifestly fibs when he scrawls ‘<span class="persName">Edward Corrocke</span> ys A good boye wytnes of <span class="persName">Davide
                phillip Ane</span>’ (Corrock’s name also occurs at fol. 132<span class="hi super">v</span>).
                Dated entries include the opening of an indenture ‘20 May 20 Elizabeth’ (fol. 90,
                upside down in the lower margin); and a note of ‘1560’ and ‘2 Elizabeth’ mentioning
                one ‘llewelin’ and ‘<span class="persName">John Lloyd</span>’ (fol. 153<span class="hi super">v</span>).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> These notes point to a <span class="placeName">Glamorgan</span> provenance; the county appears explicitly in the
                opening of an indenture by ‘Thomas &lt;.....&gt;’, with a reference to a locale in
                the county no longer legible (fol. 110) and the note ‘Memorandum that I <span class="persName">Adam Mychell
                of the parich of Luntwit in the counteye of glamorgane yeman</span>’ (fol. i<span class="hi super">v</span>). The place name in that entry helps provide narrower
                localisation, as do the following notes: ‘This byll witnessith that I <span class="persName">Iohn Spenser
                of flominyn</span> hath’ (fol. 73, the upper margin, perhaps earlier s. xvi); ‘The person
                of Lammayse hath a sarvay(n)t dothe stele all thinge that She may com by truth ys so
                to be hind’ (fol. 101, the lower margin, upside down); ‘this writynghe was done at
                bovebone &lt;....scraped&gt;‘ (fol. 109<span class="hi super">v</span>, the lower
                margin, upside down). The represent towns and villages in south-west Glamorgan, near
                the Bristol Channel: ‘Luntwit’ is likely to be <span class="placeName">Llantwit Major</span> with ‘flominyn’
                perhaps <span class="placeName">Flemingston</span>, a dozen miles north-east of Llantwit; ‘Lammyse’ is surely
                <span class="placeName">Llanmaes</span>, just five miles north, and ‘bovebone’ <span class="placeName">Boverton</span>, three miles east of
                Llantwit. The last of these is the home settlement of the man who was later to
                donate the volume to ChCh. This geographical concentration should encourage us to
                speculate that the institution from which this manuscript was ‘liberated’ was a
                nearby religious house, of which the most plausible candidate in the proximity would
                be the Cistercian Abbey of <span class="orgName">Margam</span>, seventeen miles from Boverton, and from whose
                library 242 titles were recorded in the <span class="title">Registrum</span> (289-91),
                though by the fifteenth century its wealth and significance had declined; MLGB3
                records four extant volumes. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The donor to ChCh was <span class="persName">Matthew Seys</span>: ‘Ex dono Matthæi Seys huius Ecclesiæ Alumni et
                Theologi 1640’ (fol. i); cf. the 1641 entry in the Donors’ Register, MS LR 1, p.
                    93<span class="hi super">b</span>, where Matthew Seys is recorded as the donor of
