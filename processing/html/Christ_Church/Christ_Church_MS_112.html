                is in gothic textura quadrata, while the bulk of the manuscript is probably all by a
                single Parkerian scribe, though writing at several sittings. For the main part (fol.
                    iii-viiiv, 1-64), he writes a bookhand which has
                    been described as ‘formal secretary’, adorned with gothic display text. This
                    combination of scripts by the same scribe is to be found in other manuscripts owned
                    by Matthew Parker, appearing, for instance, at Cambridge: Corpus Christi College, MS
                    101, pp. 145-192, MS 61 and MS 488; through the good offices of Alexandra Gillespie,

                        all in a script which is more upright but shares enough features with the main hand
                        to be equated with it; this script is also used for item 2 (fol. ii).</p>

                manuscript has decoration intended to impress. The title-page (item 3) opens its
                display script with a swag-capital from which grows a depiction of a lion and a
                leopard, both rampant. At the bottom of the text-block is painted Matthew Parker’s
                coat-of-arms (gules, on a chevron argent between three keys argent, three estoiles
                gules), topped by a cross, with the letters ‘M’ on one side and ‘P’ on another, the
                whole depicted as hanging on a drape held in place by two small lions sejant erect,

                  <span class="provenance"> This manuscript was made for <span class="persName">Archbishop Matthew
                Parker</span>, as is shown not only by the presence of his coat-of-arms at fol. 1 but also
                his distinctive red-crayon writing at top inner margin of fol. 53 and, as
                underlining, at fol. 3<span class="hi super">v</span>, 49. It is also clear that it
                was made for him within his own circle, with the scribes at work here also appearing
                in other manuscripts produced for the Archbishop. The date of construction of this
                codicologically curious confection can be estimated with some precision: the main
                part, and the closing index, was presumably compiled a little before the Ordinance
                of 1568 which is the first addition, and which, alone of the texts contemporary to
                Parker’s lifetime, is included in the opening contents list. Further additions were
                then made in or following 1573. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">Something of the later history of the volume is revealed by two letters from the
                antiquary, Samuel Drake (1687/8-1753), sent from his college of St John’s,
                Cambridge, to Archbishop Wake; they are now in our collection, among Wake’s
                documents as MS 244, items 75 and 78. Their context is that Drake was preparing his
                edition of Parker’s <span class="title">De antiquitate</span> which was to appear in
                1729 and be dedicated to the archbishop (a finely bound copy of which is in the Wake
                collection as WT.1.1). Wake, for his part, was particularly interested in the issue
                of Parker’s consecration, which had become a matter of controversy (on this, see
                Norman Sykes, <span class="title">William Wake Archbishop of Canterbury
                1657-1737</span>, 2 vols (Cambridge, 1957), 2:318-66). In the course of their
                discussions, in a letter dated 8<span class="hi super">th</span> November 1725, Drake
                mentions ‘a MS. fell into my hands, which I beg leave to mention to your Grace’; he
                goes on to describe in some detail our manuscript. He also offers to have it sent to
                the Archbishop at Lambeth. The latter clearly wrote back in the affirmative, and, in
                response, on 22<span class="hi super">nd</span> November, Drake sent the volume to him
                and explained a little more about how he came to see it: ‘the proprietor of it is Mr
                Cross vicar of Kintbury near Newbery Berks. I believe, My Lord, he wou’d be glad to
                restore it to the Lambeth Library, to which as your Grace conjectures, it most
                probably belong’d and was thence carried away in Prynne’s plunder’. The owner is
                identifiable as <span class="persName">Latimer Crosse</span>, second son of Joshua Crosse and a graduate of Wadham
                College, receiving his BA in 1688 and MA in 1692; he was vicar of Kintbury from 1719
                until his death in August 1739 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 356; TNA, PROB 20/648).
                That Crosse allowed Drake to use the volume is confirmed by the presence of the
                latter’s annotations at fol. ii<span class="hi super">r-v</span> (collating the text
                with another copy) and 70 (noting the early print history of the statutes included
                in this volume). That it then did reach Wake is confirmed by one word appearing in
                the margin of fol. 68, where Wake himself corrects the text from ‘Stafford’ to
                ‘Stratford’. Clearly, however, the volume did not pass into the library at Lambeth
                Palace and, rather, was donated to ChCh along with Wake’s other manuscripts, though
                it is not listed explicitly in the schedule of the manuscripts given by him, which
                is our MS 352/8. The inside of the upper board has a ChCh bookplate with both the
                foundation’s and Wake’s arms. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">What remains unclear is the life of our manuscript after Archbishop Parker’s death in
                1575 and before it was owned by Latimer Crosse. As has been noted, Wake hypothesised
                that the manuscript had been held at Lambeth until removed by William Prynne
                (1600-69) during Archbishop Laud’s trial. There is no internal evidence to
                corroborate the book’s presence on the South Bank. It is also perhaps to be doubted
                that the slip of paper which presently rests in the book before fol. 27 and on which
                is written ‘<span class="persName">Th. Wentworth</span>’ (s. xvii) can help us identify an owner; all that can be
                said for certain is that the script is not that of the divisive political figure,
                the earl of Stratford (1593-1641).</span>
