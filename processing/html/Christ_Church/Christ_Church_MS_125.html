                  <span class="provenance"> The scribe reveals his identity at the colophon
                to item 1 (fol. 201). Other sources allow us to flesh out the life of John Hargrave:
                he was, aged eighteen, at the English College in Rome in the year of its change of
                status from Hospice, 1579, and he trained there as a priest, his ordination as
                deacon being recorded as occurring in November 1582 (<span class="title">Liber Rvber

                37] (London, 1950), 11 [no. 37]; Anthony Kenny, ‘From Hospice to College 1559-1579’
                in
                <span class="title">The English Hospice in Rome</span> (Leominster,
                2005) [reprint of <span class="title">The Venerable</span>, 21(1962)], 218-73 (at 255n);

                    Douay</span>, intro. Thomas F. Knox (London, 1878), 358). Six years later, in the
                summer of 1585, he left Rome and, according to the records of the English College of
                Douai, which was then temporarily resident in Rheims, he arrived at their
                institution on his way to England but ‘detentus est hic ad docendam philosophiam’
                    (<span class="title">Douay Diaries</span>, 13, 207). He never did return to the land
                of his birth: on 18<span class="hi super">th</span> August 1589, he left the College:
                ‘Lotharingiam missus est ... ut in monasterio philosophiam et theologiam monachis
                praelegeret’ (<span class="title">Douay Diaries</span>, 225); on 17<span class="hi super">th</span> October of the following year, the College heard that
                their former lecturer in philosophy had died (<span class="title">Douay Diaries</span>,
                237). </span>
                  <span class="provenance">Hargrave must have begun work on this manuscript soon after he arrived in Rheims. He
                dates the completion of the first item to 29<span class="hi super">th</span> July
                1586, and then, in the second item, provides fitfully a set of dates. It would be
                natural to assume that they signal the progress of his copying but the other
                holograph manuscript of his commentary on the <span class="title">Physics</span>
                suggests another explanation. That codex, now BL, MS Add. 11493, opens with the
                title (fol. 4): ‘Prologomena in libros phisicorum domino Johanne hargravo
                praelectore in collegio Anglorum 20 octobris Rhemis’. Later in that manuscript, he
                gives some further dates, starting with ‘post pascha’ (fol. 152<span class="hi super">v</span>) and ‘10 Aprilis’ (fol. 153), and concluding with
                ‘Junij 26 1587’ (fol. 221) and ‘Junij 27’ (fol. 222). It appears, then, that the
                dates in both volumes are intended to reflect the progress not of copying but of his
                lecturing. Yet, this information can still probably help us date the two volumes:
                BL, MS. Add. 11493 opens with a date earlier than those in our manuscript but then
                picks up the dating about six weeks after the last mention of a day in our
                manuscript. That lack of overlap in datings, combined with the incomplete nature of
                our manuscript suggests that Hargrave abandoned this volume, copied out the sections
                he had written into his second copy and then continued with that one. So, we have an
                approximate, if not a precise, date for production of the manuscript: it would seem
                likely that he began working on it late in 1585, probably paused between ending the
                first item and beginning the second, and eventually abandoned it in late February or
                early March 1587. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">We might hypothesise how this work by a recusant came to be bound probably in England
                in the decades after its production. A possible scenario is that Hargrave left the
                manuscript at Rheims and that the owner who had his initials stamped onto the
                binding was a member of the College. If so, the most likely candidate would be
                Thomas Manger, who was from the Winchester diocese, arrived at the College in Rheims
                on 8<span class="hi super">th</span> September 1586 – that is, in the months Hargrave
                was working on our manuscript – ‘ut dialecticae operam daret’ (<span class="title">Douay Diaries</span>, 15, 212); he was sent to the College in Rome in September
                1587 but returned to Rheims a few years later, after Hargrave had died (<span class="title">Liber Rvber</span>, p. 63 [no. 192]). He was ordained in Rheims in
                1592 and proposed to be ‘repetitor’ for the College in Douai (<span class="title">Douay Diaries</span>, 214, 217, 243, 244, 248-250, 280). He was there at the
                start of December 1594 (<span class="title">Letters of William Allen and Richard
                    Barret 1572-1598</span>, ed. P. Renold [Catholic Record Society, 38] (Oxford,
                1967), 302), but, soon after, his career was to take him back to England where he
                became Catholic Archdeacon of Somerset and Dorset, and was still alive in 1612
                (Joseph Gillow, <span class="title">A Literary and Biographical History, or
                    bibliographical dictionary of the English Catholics...</span>, 5 vols (London,
                1885-1887), 4:401-402; Michael Questier,
                <span class="title">Newsletters from the Archpresbyterate of George Birkenhead </span>(Cambridge,
                1998), 172n). It seems that he was himself something of an author, collecting
                information on English Catholic martyrs (L. E. Whatmore, ‘The Venerable William
                Pike, Layman’, <span class="title">Recusant History</span>, 9 (1968), 258-63 (259);
                Richard Challoner, <span class="title">Memoirs of Missionary Priests</span>, ed. John H.
                Pollen (London, 1924), 169, 198). If he was, indeed, the owner of our volume, then
                he presumably returned with it to England, and had it bound there. Perhaps it was
                him who pored over the book after dark: there are wax stains which we can take to be
                from a candle (eg fol. 162<span class="hi super">v</span> [‘foll. 324’]). </span>
                  <span class="provenance">We do not know by what route the manuscript descended from Manger – or whoever was
                ‘<span class="persName">TM</span>’ – to its donor to Christ Church a century later. The gift is recorded in an
                inscription at the first flyleaf: ‘Librum Hunc Bibliothecae Ædis X<span class="hi super">ti</span> Oxon Donavit Gulielmus Carpender Parochiae de Stanton
                super Vagam in Agro Herefordensi Rector. eiusdem Ædis olim Alumnus. A. D. 1707’.
                This is corroborated by the entry in the Library Donors’ Book, p. 230<span class="hi super">b</span>, where it is noted that the same <span class="persName">William Carpender</span>
                also gave our MS 92 (to which turn for discussion of this Houseman). The combination
                of books made an odd coupling. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">There is the former New Library shelf-mark ‘G7’ at the inside of the upper board (see
                Appendix IV). It had earlier appeared as an addition in the Archives catalogue begun
                in 1676 (see Appendix I, <span class="hi bold">[16]</span>). </span>
