                within the appropriate time-span would be <span class="persName">William Overton, bishop 1580-1609</span>.</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The book came to ChCh from <span class="persName">Samuel Burton</span>: ‘Liber Ecclesiæ Christi Oxon’ ex dono
                Samuelis Burtoni, in artibus Magistri, et eiusdem Ecclesiæ Alumni. anno D. 1595’
                (fol. ii<span class="hi super">v</span>); this small script appears to be his own, as
                may be the notes in a larger script at fol. ii and fol. ii<span class="hi super">v</span>, which are now erased and irretrievable under UV, apart from the date
                ‘1588’. A Staffordshire man (thus from Lichfield diocese), he matriculated in 1586
                and received his BA in 1588 and his MA in 1591. He was from 1594 rector of Dry
                Marston (Gloucs.) and of Stratton-upon-Fosse from 1597. In 1607, he was appointed
                archdeacon of Gloucester; he died in 1634 aged about 65 (<span class="title">AO</span>,
                218). The researches of David Selwyn have identified him as an owner of printed
                books, sometimes, as in Dublin: Trinity College, A.1.34 (Jan Hus, <span class="title">Epistolae</span> (Wittenberg, 1537), previously owned by Thomas Cranmer) with the
                motto ‘Nihil homine vel inferius vel superius’; Dr Selwyn’s discoveries will be
                available on-line on the Oxford Bibliographical Society website in his supplement to
                his own
                <span class="title">The Library of Thomas Cranmer </span>(Oxford,
                1996). The dates of Burton’s career make it implausible that he came by this
                manuscript in Chester or that he was in the suite of Robert Dudley, earl of
                Leicester, on his visit to that city, as was proposed by Barker, ‘Discovery’;
                Dudley’s progress to Shropshire and Cheshire took place in May and June 1584, at a
                time when Burton was not yet even an undergraduate: Simon Adams,
                <span class="title">Leicester and the Court: essays on Elizabethan politics </span>(Manchester,
                2002), 324.</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Thomas James saw the manuscript at Christ Church and catalogued it in his <span class="title">Ecloga</span> as MS 3 (52): ‘Polychronica Ranulphi cognomento
                Higden’. There is also an extensive note on King Alfred (fol. 130, s. xvii; cf. fol.
                    105<span class="hi super">v</span>). At the front pastedown, there are the former
                ChCh shelfmarks, ‘B.2’, cancelled, relating to the 1676 Catalogue (Appendix I), and
                the New Library’s ‘F.2’ (this latter also appears at the foot of fol. 1, in both
                cases in Smallwell’s hand; see Appendix IV).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Despite the appearance of a continuous presence in the Library, it may be that for
                some of its time in Christ Church’s ownership, it wandered. It is not mentioned in
                the Old Archive Catalogue (Appendix II) and its absence may be explained by a note
                at the verso of the final flyleaf of the Library Accounts, MS LR 16, where it is
                recorded (perhaps by Philip Birt, the Library Keeper 1717-20) ‘Mem y<span class="hi super">t</span> Hon. B. Calvert borrow’d Higden’s Polychron. {not
                returned)’. The negligent borrower was <span class="persName">Benedict Calvert (1700-32)</span> who matriculated in
                1716 and left in 1723; on him, see Troy O. Bickham in <span class="title">Oxford
