                  <span class="provenance"> This manuscript is, in truth, less significant
                than it has sometimes been claimed to be. Kitchin rather hopefully noted that ‘this
                is probably the original MS. of the work’ (52), even though Cavendish composed his
                work in the reign of Mary and the script of our manuscript can be no earlier than
                the very late sixteenth century. It has also been said that it was ‘probably used as
                copy for the first published edition’ of <span class="title">The Life</span> (Paul
                Morgan, <span class="title">Oxford Libraries outside the Bodleian</span>, 2<span class="hi super">nd</span> ed. (Oxford, 1980), 28), but the differences between
                the text here and in the printing for William Sheares in 1641 [Wing C1619 and cf.
                C.1619aA] are significant enough to require us definitively to discount that
                possibility. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">Perhaps Kitchin was encouraged to make his mistake by giving too much credence to a
                note at the inside of the front board: ‘This book was wrote in the Reign of Queen
                Mary’. That note had been crossed out by the time that Kitchin came to see it and
                replaced with a note immediately below it, in a different hand: ‘See Anthony Woods
                account of the Cardinal wherein Is drawn up a Better account than in this Author as
                I think[.] Note A. Wood in his Athenae P 280 vol 11<span class="hi super">us</span>
                says that Tho: Storer <span class="add">Student</span> of Xt Church wrote the Cardinals life in 10 shettes
                in quarto in English verse &amp; printed it in 1599’ (on Thomas Storer (d. 1604) see
                Matthew Steggle in <span class="title">Oxford DNB</span>). The author of this note is
                probably responsible for the few marginalia in the manuscript (fol. 4, 12, 16, 20<span class="hi super">v</span> and 92), and perhaps for the note at the inside of the
                lower board (‘Cawood 7 miles from York’). It is possible that their author is Thomas
                Tanner. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">There is no explicit evidence for the context of the production of this manuscript or
                of its early history. This uncertainty includes the date of transcription: Kitchin,
                as we have seen, is over-influenced by pietas when he dates it ‘saec. xvi’;
                Sylvester, in his edition, suggests ‘ca. 1600’, while Peter Beal in his on-line
                Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts proposes ‘c. 1630’ [last accessed 9<span class="hi super">th</span> May 2014]. The positioning of the marks of a chain
                staple is unique in the ChCh collection and suggests that the volume was chained in
                another institutional library before it arrived in its present home. This hypothesis
                gains weight by considering the chronological limits for its arrival in ChCh: it is
                not recorded in the 1676 catalogue (at which point those manuscripts which had been
                chained were liberated; see Appendix I); it is, on the other hand, present in that
                of 1717, with the shelfmark ‘L2’ (see Appendix II, and cf. Appendix III, B.18).
                Characteristically of the collection, the 1717 shelfmark is not recorded in the
                volume itself; the only one to appear there – at both inner upper board and top
                right of fol. 1 – is ‘E10’, the number it had in the New Library (see Appendix IV),
                entered into the volume by Edward Smallwell. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">This is not the only manuscript copy of Cavendish’s
                <span class="title">Life</span> in the Library. The next shelfmark,
                MS 155, is occupied by an eighteenth-century transcript, the origins of which are
                explained by a note at its first flyleaf:

                our manuscript, written by Richard Hind, Librarian 1748-53 (on whom see headnote to
                Appendix II): ‘This Life was written by Tho. Cavendish: of which there is another
                Copy L.2 [<span class="hi italic">with </span>E.10 <span class="hi italic">added in pencil</span>]’. MS 155 has not been highly regarded: Kitchin notes
                laconically that ‘it is of no value’ (53); Thomas Vere Bayne, Librarian 1872-99,
                considered both it and this manuscript ‘very bad’ copies of Cavendish’s work (signed
