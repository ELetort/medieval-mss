                     There are some signs
                    of early and later use. Apart from the textual additions and corrections, which
                    are fairly dense in the first 120 folios and again in the final folios, there is
                    a more cursive script that annotates, adds cross-references in the Psalter and,
                    in the early part of the volume, adds a leaf-shaped nota mark (eg fol. 31, 45<span class="hi super">v</span>, 52, 53, 53<span class="hi super">v</span>, 55, 57,
                    61 (with Latin original noted), 64, 79, 91<span class="hi super">v</span>, 92<span class="hi super">v</span>, 101, 130<span class="hi super">v</span>, 134, 141,
                    170, 175, 214, 364, 380). Another reader demonstrates interest in the tale of
                    the Judgement of Solomon by making two pen and ink drawings in the margin (fol.
                    106). Much later, a reader writing in a humanist-influenced script in brown ink
                    (s. xvi<span class="hi super">med</span>) notes a comparison with the ‘versio
                    Gallicana’ (fol. 275<span class="hi super">v</span>, next to Daniel 8:5, glossing
                    ‘buc of goet’). Considering the likely date of the annotation, it is legitimate
                    to wonder whether this might be the work of <span class="persName">Robert Clay</span>, who is identified as a

                    1887), 195-96), also Edward, came up to Christ Church in 1581, and earned the
                    degrees of BA and MA in 1582/3 and 1586, respectively. He was rector of Green’s
                    Norton (Northants.) until his death in 1631, aged about 67 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 1314). There is, in the margin of fol. 1 of the manuscript, a note
                    of his donation, presumably in his own hand (it is certainly not that of his
                    father): ‘Liber Ecclesiæ Christi ex dono <span class="persName">Edouardi Saunders Armigeri de Flower</span> in
                    Com: Northamptoniae’. Though the note is undated, we can use the material
                    evidence of the binding to surmise a date of donation: the chain-staple, 55mm in
                    length and 20mm wide, is unusual among those used at ChCh but it identical in
                    dimensions to some of the staples provided for the printed books given by
                    Mildred, Lady Burghley (on which, see Introduction); her donation was made in
                    1586, the year of Saunders’ MA, suggesting he gave the book at the time of his
                    graduation. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">That the manuscript was not, like all other early arrivals, re-chained in the
                    early seventeenth century must be a function of its bulk: it was presumably
                    stored sitting on its side, while its smaller colleagues were to be stored
                    upright, and its abnormality meant altering its chaining was considered
                    unnecessary. That it remained in its horizontal position into the eighteenth
                    century is suggested by its position in the 1676 Catalogue (see Appendix I).</span>
                  <span class="provenance">The manuscript was seen and catalogued by James (52) as MS 1: ‘Biblia Anglice vel
                    Saxonice’. The manuscript contains, at front pastedown, the shelfmark relating
                    to the 1676 Catalogue, ‘D.1’ (see Appendix I); it also has the New Library
                    shelfmark ‘E.4’ (the latter in Edward Smallwell’s hand) at both top left of the
                    front pastedown and top right of fol. iii. Smallwell also notes at top centre of
                    fol. iii: ‘The Old &amp; New Testament in Wickliffe’s Translation. Vide G10’,
                    cross-referencing this manuscript with our MS. 146, where a similar note occurs. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Attached to the same folio is a letter from one of the editors of the Wycliffite
                    Bible, Josiah Forshall, dated 14 July but without a year (fols i-ii). In it, he
                    thanks the Dean and Chapter for loan of the manuscript for collation and
                    praising the quality of its text. Behind this lies a tale which is reconstructed
                    by Dove, <span class="title">First English Bible</span>, 143 where she comments that
                    ‘unfortunately, Forshall and [Frederic] Madden do not make use of the Christ
                    Church Bible in the Old Testament. Forshall was to blame for this: after
                    visiting Oxford to locate bibles in the Earlier Version, he reported that Christ
                    Church had none. Madden later notes: “This was a fatal mistake”.’ So, Forshall’s
                    letter to the Dean (which presumably dates from the early 1830s, but after 1832
                    as that is when Madden, described here as ‘Sir F. Madden’, was knighted) stating
                    that ‘in point of completeness [it] has only one or two others equal to it’ was
                    akin to atonement for his earlier oversight.</span>
