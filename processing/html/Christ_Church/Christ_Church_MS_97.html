                    Essays Presented to N. R. Ker</span> (London, 1978), 251-77 at 261 notes this mark
                and the very similar one on MS 115 but does not explicitly claim they are evidence
                of medieval chaining; in fact, comprehensive comparison with other ChCh manuscripts
                shows that this mark dates from early in its time in this institution. No front pastedown (a ChCh bookplate glued to the board); the rear pastedown old
                parchment, now partially raised. No flyleaves. Christopher Clarkson studied the
                binding in June 2011; among his observations was the fact that ‘the lower

                 The volume belonged to <span class="orgName">St
                Albans abbey</span> from an early date: ‘Hunc librum dedit <span class="persName">domnus fabianus Supprior Beato
                albano</span> Quem qui ei abstulerit uel ab eius ecclesia alienauerit anathema sit’ (fol.
                1, upper margin, s. xiii). Thus identified by MLGB3 as a St Albans book; it also
                appears in Thomson’s listing of St Albans books as no. 57 (1:111); he suggests
                (1:63) that it may have been made in-house. At 1:46-47, 54, 63 Thomson presents what
                is known of the donor, Fabian. Apparently Italian, he came to St Albans with three
                Englishmen who had been studying in Salerno about 1160; he was subprior in 1214 and
                died at an advanced age in 1223. He also gave the abbey library BodL, MSS Finch e.25
                (a New Testament) and Rawl. C.31 (sermons of William of Newburgh and glosses to
                Comestor) (Thomson, no. 45 and 51 respectively).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> The book most likely remained in the abbey library until the Dissolution: ‘<span class="persName">Iohannes
                Beriman</span> Qui diligit iniquitatem odit animam suam [Ps. 10:6] / ambrosius de
                ecclesiasticis officiis de almariolo’ (s. xvi<span class="hi super">med</span>,
                written around the note of Fabian’s donation; the Ambrose reference [perhaps the
                attraction of Ambrose’s ‘De officiis ministrorum’?] is also written on the raised
                rear pastedown); and ‘Ihon Berimone ow[n]eth this boke’ (fol. 1, lower margin,
                cancelled). He also owned MS 115 (see  in that
                description), and certainly possessed yet another St Albans manuscript, BL, MS.
                Harl. 865, on which see both C. E. Wright, <span class="title">Fontes Harleiani</span>
                (London, 1972), 291-92 and the on-line description provided by the British Library
                Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts [last accessed 22<span class="hi super">th</span>
                August 2012]. This strongly suggests that he was close at hand to take possession of
                some of the monastery’s prestigious collection soon after the Dissolution, though he
                is not among the St Albans monks listed as pensioned by Sir Henry Chauncy, <span class="title">The Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire</span>, 2 vols (1826;
                rep. Dorking, 1975), 2:287, and the evidence of MS 115 may suggest he was not the
                first post-Dissolution owner. In this context, the efforts of the last abbot,
                Richard Boreman (may Beriman be related to him?) and of others to preserve something
                of the monastic community and possibly to revive it during the Marian restoration of
                Catholicism may not be irrelevant: see J. G. Clark, ‘Reformation and Reaction at St
                Albans Abbey, 1530-58’,
                <span class="title">English Historical Review, </span>cxv (2000),
                297-328. </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> After Beriman, the book appears to have been on the market, for it was bought by
                <span class="persName">Samuel Purchas</span>: ‘Samuel Purchas emit’ (fol. 1, lower margin, after cancelling the
                Beriman inscription). Purchas’s name and the title (the latter not in his hand) are
                also written on the turn-in of the upper board. Purchas (1577-1626) received his BA
                from St John’s College, Cambridge in 1596/7, followed by an MA in 1600; he was
                incorporated at Oxford as BD in 1615; he was rector of St Martin-within-Ludgate
                1614-26 and a fellow of King James’s College, Chelesa 1621-24; the travel history
                for which he is best known, <span class="title">Purchas his Pilgrimage</span>, was first
                published in 1613 and repeatedly revised (<span class="title">AC</span>, 3:407; <span class="title">AO</span>, 1221; David Armitage in <span class="title">Oxford
                DNB</span>). The Donors’ Register, MS LR 1, pp. 53b-54a, records, for the year 1617,
                Purchas’s gift of this manuscript (as item <span class="hi bold">[5]</span>) and other
