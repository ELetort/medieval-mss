                              <br/>The mise-en-page alters
                               between items, with the consistent features of the text being formed of long lines
                               which are not ruled, always placed within a ruled border. As a result of these
                               factors, the number of lines varies, sometimes substantially within an item. In the
                               first main text, item 2, the written space is 121/24 x 65mm, marked by a set of
                               binding lines extending to the edges of the pages and supplemented by an outer
                               border, creating margins of 13/16mm, and there are 37-38 lines. In the next main
                               text, item 4, the text-block is marked by binding lines forming a rectangle but the
                               size changes: in the opening sections (up to fol. 103), it is 121/23 x 73mm,
                               providing 44 lines; after that point, it is 113 x 53mm and 33 lines. This last
                               layout continues in item 5. For items 6 and 8, the text-block is marked by a red
                               rectangle measuring 119 x 73mm, with an extra binding line added within the
                               rectangle 3mm from the left to create a column in which to place stanza numbers;
                               there are 48-49 lines to a page. Item 7 and 9 are distinguished from items 4 and 6
                               by the rectangle and extra binding line being in the gray-black ink used for the
                               text; the rectangle is c. 123 x 69mm, and the number of lines varies between 46 and
                               56. Item 10 has its rectangle in red, measuring 123 x 82mm, with one extra binding
                               line, placed within the rectangle 20mm from the right to allow annotations; there
                               are 40 lines.</p>

                     <p class="decoNote"> The mise-en-page,
                setting the text within a rectangle, has been described above. In addition, there
                are running headers in all items. The scribe also adds, as well as the opening
                title-page (item 1), some initials, mainly concentrated in items 2 and 4. The
                preface to item 2 opens at fol. 2 with a 10-line initial, including a grotesque, in
                red, yellow and blue. Through this item and the next, there are two types of
                initials, the first providing foliage around letter, imitating printed initials;
                they occur at fol. 3 (9 lines), 8<span class="hi super">v</span> (8 lines), 83 (9
                lines, in red, with short border), 96 (10 lines), 117 (4 lines, with gold and red,
                and short border), 118 (4 lines, gold, with red used for half-border), 118<span class="hi super">v</span> (likewise, with border including Tudor rose), 119
                (likewise, but 5 lines), 119<span class="hi super">v</span> (5 lines, letter in black
                and gold), 120<span class="hi super">v</span> (5 lines), 122<span class="hi super">v</span> (likewise), 260<span class="hi super">v</span> (9 lines), 276<span class="hi super">v</span> (likewise), 277 (8 lines). The other style involves
                grisaille historiated initials, occurring at fol. 95 (10 lines, <span class="hi italic">all’antica</span> vase and foliage), 99<span class="hi super">v</span> (grapes and
                acorn), 101 (with red outlining), 119<span class="hi super">v</span> (5 lines, turkey
                with red throat, a notably early depiction, given that William Strickland’s grant of
                arms including the bird he had imported from the New World occurred in 1550), 120 (5
                lines, acorn, with nut in red and letter in gold), 123 (5 lines, artichoke), 124 (4
                lines, fruit and flower) 125<span class="hi super">v</span> (6 lines, grotesque), 133
                (8 lines), 134<span class="hi super">v</span> (6 lines, Tudor rose and pomengrate in
                the compartments of ‘B’, on the stem the letters ‘RO’ and ‘RT’), 136<span class="hi super">v</span> (5 lines, bird, branch and fruit), 137 (6 lines,
                knotted letter ‘A’). Item 5 opens, at fol. 311, with an initial of 9 lines in which
                the letter grows leaves, with sections painted in blue and gold, and grisaille. In
                item 6, there is also an historiated initial, at fol. 417, the letter ‘T’ formed by
                a bird and cornucopia with a roll reading ‘cantate domino nouum’ (Psalm 98); the
                initial is the height of two staves, which, in this item and item 10, have black
                notation on red lines. In addition, in this item and item 8, the first letter of
                each Psalm is rubricated, as is the name of the composer. In item 9, the notation is
                written on black lines. </p>

                  <span class="provenance"> The scribe gives his
                surname as Tyas at fol. 1, and, at fol. 134<span class="hi super">v</span>, provides,
                in the initial, clues to his Christian name being Robert. In addition, at fol.
                    114<span class="hi super">v</span>, he draws a manicula pointing to 14 December
                and, in outer margin, a drawing of two hands joined with, above, the date ‘1573’.
                From these snippets of information, it is possible to identify him as the Robert
                Tyas who married Millisent Browne in 1573: <span class="title">London Marriage

                provided on 8 December. He was a servant to the Royal Wardrobe, eventually being its
                Clerk in the 1590s and first years of the seventeenth century: <span class="title">CSP

                and 55). It is perhaps Robert himself (since the script is of the late sixteenth
                century) who adds in secretary script a note at the top of fol. 579: ‘A quiet life
                who list to lead | let him vouchsafe these lines to read | &amp; redding print them
                in his mind | a quiet life then shall he find’. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">It would appear that the volume descended within the family, since it was another
                Tyas who gave it to Christ Church. It is recorded in the Donors’ Register (MS LR 1),
                under the year 1675, at p. 174a:

                  </span>
                  <span class="provenance">Born in Middlesex 1610 or 1611, <span class="persName">Thomas Tyas</span> or Tias, went up to Christ Church 24

                ordained deacon on 22 December 1639 (<span class="title">AO</span>; CCED). His later
                career is not fully clear but he was still in residence at ChCh in 1648 when he
                crossed with the Parliamentarian Visitors (<span class="title">The Register of the
                    Visitors of the University of Oxford from A.D. 1647 to A.D. 1658</span>, ed.
                Montagu Burrows, Camden Society (London, 1881), 30 and 130). </span>
                  <span class="provenance">The one complicating factor is the presence of the letters ‘MS’ on both boards of the
                binding. Though these might simply signify this is a manuscript, it would be more
                customary for them to stand for a person’s initials. If so, there is one relative of
                Thomas Tyas for whom they would be appropriate: the scribe, Robert, had a daughter
                who was christened Margaret and who in 1600 married Thomas (b. 1568; fl. 1634), one
                of the sons of Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York (E. S. Sandys, <span class="title">History of the family of Sandys</span>, 2 vols (Barrow-in-Furness, 1930), 2:
                pedigree C). Her married initials were thus ‘MS’ and so perhaps she inherited this
                volume and it was bound for her. If so, it was patently returned later to the family
                of her birth.</span>
                  <span class="provenance">This manuscript arrived just in time to appear in the 1676 catalogue (Appendix I, <span class="hi bold">[15]</span>) but the shelfmark recorded there does not appear in the
                book itself. The only shelfmark at the inside of its upper board is written by
                Edward Smallwell and is the New Library ‘G.13’. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">Within the manuscript is kept evidence of later interest in the volume: a two-page
                typed letter from the hymnologist and Vicar of Deddington, Maurice Frost
                (1888-1961), dated 16 February 1940, is stuck to fol. i<span class="hi super">v</span>, while a typescript description of items 6 to 10 (undated) by the English
                scholar, W[illiam A.] Ringler (1912-87) is kept loose with it; there is also a
                twentieth-century pencil note by ‘TYP’ at fol. 587. All those concentrate their
                attention on the metrical Psalms with notation; their comments are summarised in the
                on-line ChCh Music Catalogue. </span>
