                  <span class="provenance">
                     There are two
                    indications of medieval use, neither at all specific about the context: (a)
                    ‘Epistole Pauli glosate glosa cum interlineari’ (the front pastedown; anglicana,
                    s. xv in., same hand as inscription on lower board); (b) erased inscriptions of
                    ownership (the front and rear pastedowns, fols i, 161<span class="hi super">v</span>, 162), as also ‘Cum sumus in celo letemur pectore leto Ryght
                    welbelo&lt; &gt;‘ (fol. i, s. xv).</span>
                  <span class="provenance"> In the late sixteenth century, the book belonged to <span class="persName">Thomas Carpender</span>: ‘Amicitia
                    Mortui viuunt | Pariuntur voluptates pecunia’ (not in Walther), followed by an
                    erased ownership note (‘Thomas Carpender me possidet’), above which he also
                    writes ‘Kyngesham’ (the rear pastedown); and the erased ‘Thomas Carpender’,
                    above a motto ‘Nil plus valet ad ponendum laborem’ (fol. i); he also signed
                    between epistles: his name is still visible at fol. 78<span class="hi super">v</span> and in the initial at fol. 134<span class="hi super">v</span>; further
                    erased instances are at fol. 30<span class="hi super">v</span>, 59<span class="hi super">v</span> and 161<span class="hi super">v</span>. A longer
                    version of the motto, ‘Nil plus valet ad ponendum laborem quam quid cognitum sit
                    nil profici aut frustra si esse susceptum’ appears on fol. 162<span class="hi super">v</span>. Carpender was the person on whom the manor and
                    advowson of Kingsham, near Chichester, was settled in 1562: see <span class="hi italic">VCH Sussex</span>, 3:105. As he wrote the loconym on the end
                    pastedown with his note of possession, Carpender may have come by this volume
                    after that date, but, if so, he could not have enjoyed it for long. By the end
                    of 1565 he was dead, for the following year his executors established a
                    scholarship at his <span class="hi italic">alma mater</span>, Magdalen College, Oxford
                    on 10<span class="hi super">th</span> February 1566.</span>
                  <span class="provenance">There are further unspecific indications of late sixteenth- or early
                    seventeenth-century use: (a) ‘<span class="persName">Robertus &lt;......&gt;</span>‘ (erased) with motto ‘Viue
                    vt viuas’ (fol. i); (b) ‘Virtutis premium laus’ (the front pastedown).</span>
                  <span class="provenance">Some of
                    these may postdate the book’s donation to ChCh: ‘Liber ecclesiae Christi Oxon ex
                    dono <span class="persName">Johannis Howsoni</span> Anno 1588<span class="hi super">o</span>’ (fol. i<span class="hi super">v</span>); the inscription is in the donor’s hand (cf. the
                    inscription in, for example, the printed book B.1.1). Howson was born in London,
                    and was at Christ Church in 1577. He received the degrees of BA in 1578 and MA
                    in 1581/2 (incorporated at Cambridge, 1583). He was licensed to preach in 1597,
                    a canon of Christ Church in 1601, BD and DD in 1601, vice-chancellor in 1602,
                    prebendary of Hereford from 1587 and of Exeter from 1592, and vicar of several
                    Oxfordshire parishes; in 1610, he was one of the first fellows of Matthew
                    Sutcliffe’s short-lived King James’s College, Chelsea. Further promotion came in
                    1618, when he was named as bishop of Oxford, a see he held until 4 July 1628,
                    when he was translated to Durham. He held that bishopric until his death on 6
                    February 1632 (<span class="title">AO</span>, 757; Nicholas W. S. Cranfield
                    in <span class="title">Oxford DNB</span>). As vice-chancellor,
                    Howson’s anti-puritan views involved him in sectarian controversy (<span class="hi italic">HUO</span>, 422). In addition to this codex, over his career, he
                    donated a few printed books to ChCh: on 18<span class="hi super">th</span> January
                    1587, Paolo Giovio, <span class="title">Vitae duodecim Vicecomitum Mediolani
                        principum</span> (Paris, 1549) [C.2.4.12]; on 18<span class="hi super">th</span>
                    May 1602, Panormitanus, <span class="title">super decretales</span>, 4 vols
                    ([Lyons], 1501) [B.1.1.1-4], and in 1614, Lorenzo Giustiniani, <span class="title">Opera</span> ([Paris], 1524) [I.3.3.8]; the first two gifts are noted by Ker,
                    ‘Provision of Books’, nos 1587.1 and 1602.1 (508, 511), and the last (the only
                    one in which he does not write an inscription) is entered in the Library Donors’
                    Book (p. 22<span class="hi super">a</span>). The second and third of these printed
                    volumes have manuscript pastedowns. He also assisted the Library on at least one
                    other occasion: in the Disbursement Book for Hilary 1591, he signs for a payment
                    of 18d ‘to the carryer for bringinge the B[ishop] of Welles his booke’ (on this,
                    see Introduction). </span>
                  <span class="provenance"> Our manuscript was seen and catalogued by James, <span class="title">Ecloga</span>,
                    52 as MS 2: ‘Glossa ordinaria et interlinearis in Epistolas Pauli’. The volume
                    has the late seventeenth-century ChCh shelfmark ‘A.1’ (cancelled) at the front
                    pastedown (see Appendix I); immediately below that and at the bottom centre of
                    fol. 1, Edward Smallwell entered the New Library shelfmark of ‘F.17’ (see
                    Appendix IV).</span>
