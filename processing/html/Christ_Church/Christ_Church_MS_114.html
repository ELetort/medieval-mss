                  <span class="provenance">Although undated and unsigned, this manuscript is
                     certainly the companion volume to MS 113 and, indeed, they were once bound as one, as is shown by a couple of factors. First, there is the shape of the opening flyleaf of this manuscript and the closing flyleaf of MS 113 – smaller than the other folios, with shared dimensions (255 x 160mm) – and the placing of the annotations – on the recto of the opening flyleaf here and mainly on the verso of the closing flyleaf in MS 113. This suggests that these flyleaves were originally conjoint and wrapped around all the quires of what are now two codices. Second, there is an overlap in annotations: the script at MS 113, fol. 158 adds text here at fol. 12<span class="hi super">v</span>-13 and one of the notes at the front flyleaf (reading: ‘Dum tempus habemus operimur bonum | Sola virtus’). The implication of this evidence, however, is that they were bound not in the order that we would expect: rather, it would appear that this manuscript preceded MS 113, so that the order of works was <span class="title">Eclogae</span>, <span class="title">Georgica</span>, <span class="title">Æneid</span>, with the coat-of-arms opening the third item. This may not have been what Contugi himself expected: as is made clear in the two descriptions, each manuscript has leaf signatures beginning with a quire ‘a’. That the two manuscripts, then, were produced as separate fascicules means there can be a scintilla of doubt about the year in which this one was produced, though it should be noted that, for both sections, the parchment is ruled identically, and that the same illuminator was employed. With such similarities, it was unsurprising that the two fascicules were made into one codex. Presumably an eighteenth-century owner (John Moore?) who found the works thus joined together was offended by the order the texts had taken and so had them divided at the point of re-binding. The fact that the title on the spine of this manuscript gives a year of production, when one is not included on its folios, strongly suggests that the parts were still together at the point they received their present bindings and that the date of the colophon in MS 113 was taken to refer to the whole. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">	There are some other Latin verses and pentrials at fol. 1 (eg a partially erased note ‘&lt;…..&gt; vadunt ad septimam…’, rubricated, s. xv<span class="hi super">2</span>, and ‘Sepius at me si me licida [<span class="hi italic">sic</span>] formosae revisas...’, s. xv<span class="hi super">ex</span>), but no further hint to early provenance. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">	This manuscript was donated to ChCh at the same time as MS 113; the inscription provided there is repeated here in the same hand (that is, by Edward Smallwell), with the succeeding shelfmark: ‘C.2. | D.D. <span class="persName">Joannes Moore</span> S.T.P. hujusce Ædis Canonicus, &amp; Sub-Decanus. An. 1766.’; on Moore, see our MS 113, and for the shelfmark, see Appendix IV.</span>
