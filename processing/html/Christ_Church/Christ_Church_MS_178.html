                        <span class="label">Note: </span> The text is a full representation of the New Testament, though, rather than being a
                strict translation of the Vulgate, it includes gloss materials, e.g. the rendition
                of Luke 14:27 (fol. 45<span class="hi super">rb</span>): ‘Et cil qui ne porte sa croiz
                et uenient apres moi ne puet estre mon deciple ce est a dire cil qui ne fet peneance
                et ne fet bonnes oeures ne puet estre mon deciple’. It presents the books in the
                usual order, and includes, starting with Romans, translations of Ker’s usual set of
                prologues (<span class="title">MMBL</span>, 1:96-97), in a version,
                according to Sneddon (1978), unique to this codex. The prologue to I Timothy has
                been repeated before II Timothy, and thereafter the prologues follow the epistles
                they should introduce. The disposition of the unique prologues, following the actual
                texts, strongly implies that they were being intercalated into this copy from a
                source alien to the text proper. The text lacks the end of Jude and the start of
                Apocalypse, owing to a removed leaf. </li>

                        <span class="label">Note: </span> Although only the New Testament, the manuscript is most likely not part of a
                two-volume set, since, in two-volume format, this Bible version usually is split at
                Proverbs; at least one other example of an independent New Testament is known. That
                said, as Berger points out (119), manuscripts like this one often accompany, as a
                second part, the Old Testament portions of Guiart des Moulins’s <span class="title">Bible historiale</span>. However, Sneddon’s extensive researches have not
                discovered any companion volume for ours. Sneddon considers this manuscript with
                three others to represent the earliest recension of the translation, which he
                proposes has was made ‘as a result of royal interest’, may have been composed in

                     <p class="decoNote"> From John 2 to Ephesians 4 (fols 53-86, the last two leaves of quire 7 to quire 11),
                each chapter has an historiated initial, with summary narrative images, usually
                three or four of them in boxes, circles, or lozenges; these intermittently, again
                probably on a quire basis, are supplemented with animals, centaurs, monsters,
                knights, etc. in the lower margin -- and these drolleries continue after
                illumination of chapter openings ceases, e.g. an archer shooting a man in the arse
                (fol. 91<span class="hi super">ra</span>, cf. fol. 121<span class="hi super">rb</span>
                ), a man preparing to slaughter an ox (fol. 93<span class="hi super">rb</span>), a
                lion attacking a stag (fol. 95<span class="hi super">ra</span>). Sneddon (1978:192)
                identifies the atelier responsible for the illumination with the one which decorated
                another copy of this text, Bern: Burgerbibliothek, MS 28. In contrast, Doris
                Oltrogge, <span class="title">Die Illustrationszyklen zur ‘Histoire ancienne jusqu’à
                    César’ (1250-1400)</span> (Frankfurt am Main, 1989), 16 suggests that the
                illuminations are related to three copies of the <span class="title">Historie</span> and
                one further manuscript, the four being The Hague: Koninklijke Bibliotheek, MS 78 D
                47; London: BL, MS Add. 19669; Pommersfelden: Gräflich Schönborn’sche
                Schlossbibliothek, MS 295, and Paris: BnF, MS nouv. acq. fran. 23686. She suggests
                all come from Lille in the third quarter of the thirteenth century, an attribution
                accepted by Elizabeth Morrison et al. ed.,
                <span class="title">Imagining the Past in France </span>(Los
                Angeles CA, 2010), 101, though it is also noted there that François Avril has made

                MB.5.24; it has no internal evidence of ownership but its binding of brown leather
                over boards with florid centrepiece is probably French (s. xvii) and has a fore-edge
                shelfmark, not from ChCh, of ‘A.78’.</span>

                  <span class="provenance">The lack of internal evidence in most of these volumes does not allow us to
                reconstruct fully Cartier’s collecting of books, though it is clear that he came to
                England with some in his possession, including our manuscript. There is one detail
                which may be significant: two of the printed books
                (<span class="hi bold">[4] </span>and <span class="hi bold">[8]</span>, if the
                latter is a.1.315) share with our manuscript signs of a chain-staple, all of them in
                the same position. As that position is unusual for Christ Church (and, anyway, by
                the time of donation, manuscripts were no longer chained: see Appendix I), it is
                likely that those two printed books and our manuscript reached Cartier from the same
                chained French library. </span>
                  <span class="provenance">The manuscript includes, in Edward Smallwell’s hand, the New Library shelfmark ‘E.6’
                at top left of the front pastedown and top right of fol. 1 (see Appendix IV). While
                this demonstrates it was placed in the Archives when the building in Peckwater Quad
                opened, in the later nineteenth century, it (along with MSS 92 and 101) was
                displayed in a glass cabinet in the Upper Library: Thompson, 247. Interest in it was
                also shown by Thomas Vere Bayne, librarian from 1872 to 1899, who is responsible for
                the slip of paper which sits between fol. 126 and 127 and has the note: ‘Here a leaf
                has been cut out, probably for the sake of the Illumination at the beginning of the
                Apocalypse. T.V.B.’ (on him as an ‘administrator extraordinary’ see Curthoys, 272). </span>
