                        <p>Andrea di Domenico Fiocchio (or Floccus) (d. 1452) wrote a tract
				in two books titled 
			 <span class="title">De potestatibus Romanorum</span> (or 
			 <span class="title">Romanis</span>), probably in the 1420s (see 
				apostolico: alcune notizie e varie lettere di Andrea Fiocchi, canonico
				fiorentino', in 
				<span class="title">Ultimi contributi alla storia degli umanisti, fascicolo I:
				  Traversariana</span> (Studi e testi, 90: Vatican City, 1939), 97-131,
			 at 97-101, 130-1). Incipits are [preface:] 'Cum per hos dies ...' (Bertalot, 
			 <span class="title">Initia humanistica</span>, II/I, no. 3757), [tract:] 'Omnium
			 deorum quas vetus Romanorum superstitio ...'. This work circulated under his
			 name (e.g. Bodleian, MS. d'Orville 50, fols. 1-31v), and anonymously (e.g. 
			 <span class="title">Sotheby &amp; Co., Important western and oriental miniatures
				... 11 December, 1961</span> (London), lot 170 and pl. 15, dated 5 Nov.
			 1465).</p>
                  
                 
                        <p>Perhaps in Fiocchio's lifetime, however, and at least as early as
				1469 (see 
				R. Sabbadini, 
				  <span class="title">Le scoperte dei codici latini e greci ne' secoli XIV e XV:
					 nuove ricerche col riassunto filologico dei due volumi</span> (Biblioteca
				  storica del rinascimento, 5: Florence, 1914), 222), an abridged
				one-book version without the preface appeared, attributed to the Augustan
				historian, Fenestella, who had indeed written a work about Roman magistrates.
				The 'Fenestella' version is titled 
			 <span class="title">De Romanorum magistratibus</span>, and opens: 'Omnium deorum
			 quos uetus Romanorum religio excoluit ...'. It is the 'Fenestella' which was
			 first printed (Venice, 1474) (see 
			 John Monfasani, 'Calfurnio's identification of pseudepigrapha
				of Ognibene, Fenestella, and Trebizond, and his attack on renaissance
				commentaries', 
				<span class="title">Renaissance quarterly</span> 41 no. 1 (1988),

                        <p>The present manuscript is a copy (with errors) of the
				Ps.-Fenestella redaction. The attribution in the rubric to 'Plinius' must refer
				to Pliny the Elder, who referred to the real Fenestella in his 
			 <span class="title">Natural History</span>.</p>
