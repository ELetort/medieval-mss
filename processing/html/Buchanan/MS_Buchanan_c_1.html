                        <span class="decoNote-p">Most of the quires which contain an illuminated initial—and
				only these quires—have the cropped remains of a series of leaf
				signatures consisting of a letter and number (notionally from a1-a6 in quire I,
				to h1-h6 in quire XVII): quire II has 'b5' extant (fol. 15r), quire V has 'c1',
				'c2', and part of 'c3' (fols. 41r-43r), quire IX has 'e2'-'e6' extant (fols.
				82r-86r), quire XII has parts of 'f2'-'f6' (fols. 112r-116r), quire XV has
				'g1'-'g5' (fols. 139r-143r), and quire XVII has parts of 'h1'-'h5' (fols.
				159r-163r). These leaf signatures were presumably provided to facilitate the
				re-assembly of the bifolia of each of these quires in the correct order, after
				they had been dis-assembled so that the illuminator could work on them. Each
				quire has a catchword except when the following quire contains an illuminated
				initial: presumably the binder assembled the quires according to catchwords,
				and on encountering a quire without a catchword, he followed it by a quire with
				leaf signatures, in alphabetical order. The purpose of the quire numbers at the
				end of quires VI, XI, and XV, is unclear; and the reason why they are each one
				ahead of the true quire number is obscure unless a prefactory quire is now
				lost; the numbers may possibly have been part of a tally of the amount of
				parchment used.</span>
                        <span class="decoNote-p">The collation shows that the makers of the book wanted to keep
				open the possibility that the <span class="hi italic">Historia</span> would be
				bound in two volumes, perhaps without the <span class="hi italic">Commentarius</span>, since the <span class="hi italic">Commentarius</span> starts on a new quire, and in the
				<span class="hi italic">Historia</span> the end of Book VII falls at the end of a
				short quire. Several copies of the <span class="hi italic">Historia</span> are
				divided into two volumes at this point; see

				binding. Sewn on five wide split/double straps, the seven sewing-stations (for
				kettle-stitching and five straps) marked-out by prickings near the gutter-edge
				of the leaves (clearly visible, e.g. fol. 1; cf. MS. Buchanan d. 4); each strap
				pegged into its channel using (wood?) pegs and pairs of ferrous nails; with
				(faded) green and yellow five-core end-bands; bound in polished brown leather
				over wood boards, each decorated in blind with the same design; working inwards
				from the edges are: a plain band flanked by fillets, a band of interlace with
				four-pointed starlets in the interstices, and another plain band flanked by
				fillets, all enclosing a rectangle of ropework containing a central square
				panel, in which is an eight-pointed star design filled with further ropework;
				all these areas, except the interlace, have punched circlets, often with traces
				of copper-coloured gilding or paste; the upper board with a rounded brass boss
				at each corner (one at the centre missing), and the remains of four textile
				strap fastenings (two at the fore-edge, and one each at top and bottom; the
				straps themselves all missing), each held with three nails (one missing) in a
				triangular pattern, the nail-heads with a punched star pattern; the lower board
				with four bosses at the corners (one missing), and one in the centre, and four
				brass rounded-fleur-de-lys-shaped clasp fittings, corresponding to those on the
				upper board, each secured with three round-headed nails (the whole board ill.
				in Hobson, 
				<span class="title">Humanists and bookbinders</span>, fig. 11); the flat spine
				with five slightly raised double bands, each compartment tooled in blind with a
				simple lattice; the second and fourth compartments lettered in gilt, probably
				for William Morris, perhaps by Messrs. Leighton (see under Provenance; cf. MS.
				Buchanan e. 15): 'L. ARETINI | HISTORIA | FLORENTINÆ |
				REIPUBLICÆ' and 'MS. | IN | MEMBRANIS'. Boxed,
