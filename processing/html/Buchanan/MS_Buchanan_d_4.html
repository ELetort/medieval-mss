                     Written in Florence and dated 1455 by the scribe 'DE
				  VARIETATE FORTVNE LIBER | QVARTVS EXPLICIT :- :- 1455.' (fol. 122r); the script
				  is attributable to the Florentine notary ser Giovanni di Piero da Stia
				  (c.1406-74), to whom de la Mare ('New research', I, 425-6, 499-500) has
				  attributed over forty manuscripts, two of them signed, and most of them dated;
				  he had previously copied the same text in 1450 (now Vatican, Ottob. lat. 2134;
				  see Merisalo, <span class="hi italic">op. cit.</span>, 27-8 no. 5). Merisalo
				  suggests that the present manuscript comes probably from the workshop of
				  Vespasiano da Bisticci (ibid., 33), but de la Mare does not include it in her
				  list of Vespasiano manuscripts (op. cit., I, 555-64).

				<span class="title">The public library of renaissance Florence</span>, 43-4):
				erased inscriptions leave doubt as to who first owned the manuscript (see
				below), but if Girolamo died after 1500, as is probable, then this manuscript,
				written in 1455, is perhaps more likely to have been commissioned by his father
				Fruosino, who seems also to have owned Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana, MS. San

				  i verso): 'This note is quite correct, with the exception that this is not the
				  copy presented to Nicolas V. and that it is not printed in the works of
				  Poggio.'; the tone is reminiscent of notes inscribed by William Beckford in his
				  books, but the hand is probably not his.</span>
