                  <span class="label">Summary of Contents: </span>Two fragments of a single leaf, with on one side a verse
				dialogue between the prehistoric Irish king, Cormac (mac Airt), and his
				poet-judge, Fítheal; and on the other, a (?) religious poem. The fragments derive from a single leaf written
				in two columns. Fragment A is a vertical strip from the centre of the leaf,
				preserving the inter-columnar space, and strips of varying widths from each
				column to left and right of it, on each side; fragment B contains a broader
				strip of text from only one column, on each side. It is by no means certain
				which side of the reconstructed leaf was recto, and which verso. The fragments
				were arranged and numbered in 1997 following the reconstruction by Prof. Brian
				Ó Cuív, which makes the flesh side the recto, with both fragments
				deriving from the outer part of the leaf. Under this reconstruction, on the
				recto there survive one thin strip from the extreme right of col. I (Fragm. Ar,
				col. I) and two broader but separated strips from col. II (Fragm. Ar, col. II,
				and Fragm. Br), whilst on the verso are two broad, separated strips of col. I
				(Fragm. Bv, and Fragm. Av, col. I) and one thin strip from the left edge of its
				col. II (Fragm. Av, col. II). The following identifications of texts are based on
				Prof. Ó Cuiv's work.</p>

                     <p>The primary argument about
				the priority of the sides depends on the relationship between Texts 3 and 4:
				Text 3 occupies the end of the second column of its page, whilst Text 4 starts
				at the top of the first column of the other. If Text 3 ends incomplete, it must
				have fallen at the bottom of a verso, to continue on the following leaf, now
				missing; if however it is complete in its present four quatrains, Text 4 could
				have followed it, but still need not certainly have done so. The fact that the
				last surviving letters of Text 3 fall on the 28th line of its column, with the
				29th line apparently blank, suggests that that poem is indeed complete.</p>
                     <p>A secondary argument in support of this arrangement depends on the
				activities of the binder who cut up the leaf into narrow vertical strips. Each
				surviving strip is <span class="hi italic">c</span>.33-9 mm. wide, and the gap
				between them is also approximately the same: such uniformity suggests that the
				whole leaf was cut up into vertical strips of approximately equal width. On
				that hypothesis, at least one further strip would have been cut away at the
				left-hand side of Fragm. Bv, which preserves most of the starts of its
				text-lines. A left-hand blank margin of c.33-9 mm. would probably be too wide
				for the inner margin of a recto, but perfectably acceptable for the outer
				margin of a verso.</p>

                     <p class="decoNote">Headings (as surviving for Texts 3, 4, and 5(?)) in plain ink, that of Text 4 in perhaps slightly smaller script. The possible identification of lines 28 and ?29 of Fragm. Bv, col. I, as the heading for Text 5, depends on the presence of a horizontal line of red below line 27, for which the easiest explanation would be as a division-marker of some sort between two texts. Capitals at the starts of texts (as surviving for Texts 3 and 4) are plain ink capitals by the scribe, but written somewhat larger and more boldly (Text 3's 'A' approx. 2 lines high, Text 4's 'M' approx. 1½ lines); smaller ink capitals, perhaps slightly larger than one line, survive at the starts of quatrains (Texts 2-4) and at two points of Text(s?) 5 (i.e. in col. II on the recto, and in both cols. on the verso), and are stressed by being written to the left of the main written space of each column. Both larger and smaller capitals are partly infilled with touches of colour, those on the recto (col. II surviving only) with a pale brownish yellow, those on the verso (both columns) with a purplish red; run-over marks somewhat like a pair of reversed 'S's or back-slashes ('\\') occur on Fragm. Br, col. II, lines 1, 6, 9, and 12, and are perhaps touched with a very faint stroke of pale colour.</p>

				were used as reinforcing-strips at the front and back of a binding of large
				quarto or small folio size, covered perhaps in calf, with five spine-bands and
