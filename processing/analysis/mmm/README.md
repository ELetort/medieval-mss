This folder contains:

 * XQuery scripts for extracting information in the TEI files in this repository (both manuscript records and authority files) into an intermediate form.
 * The mapping and generator files need by the [x3ml](https://github.com/delving/x3ml) tool to create RDF, using the CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo ontologies, from that intermediate form.

Instructions for how to do so will be added here soon.
