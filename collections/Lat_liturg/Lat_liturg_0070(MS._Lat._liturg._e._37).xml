                           19th-cent. ink in the middle of the upper margin, by the same hand as in
                           MS. lat. liturg. e. 39: 1-155, the endleaves foliated in modern pencil:
                           i-iii, 157-159; another late 19th- or early 20th-cent. pencil foliation
                           which is erased up to fol. 12, the continues from '82', suggesting that
                           70 more leaves were present at the start of the volume until shortly
                           before the c.1910 binding; there are also
                           the remains of an 18th- or 19th-cent. foliation in ink, now mostly
                           erased and/or cropped, of which '5[.]' (fol. 43r) and '69' (fol. 52) are
                           still visible; less clear is '116'(?) (fol. 163); this last foliation
                           survives unerased in Ms. lat. liturg. e. 6, and on the full-page leaves
                           in MS. Lat. liturg. d. 42</foliation>
